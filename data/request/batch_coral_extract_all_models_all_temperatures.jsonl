She had a mastectomy with sentinel node and implant reconstruction in June 2013 and had  2.3 and 2.4 cm tumors found with a negative sentinel node.  The tumors were G2,  ER and PR positive and her 2 neu negative.  She did not have radiation or chemotherapy and declined tamoxifen.  She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. \n ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.  We discussed how treatment would be palliative but that treatment could improve her quality of life as well as length of life.  She asked me multiple times if this can be cured.       I will refer her to the ***** center.  I also ordered a MRI of brain and bone scan as well as labs to complete her work up.

Left breast, mag seed-localized partial mastectomy:   1. Tumor bed with chronic inflammation.  2. Biopsy site changes.   3. Proliferative fibrocystic change with focal usual ductal hyperplasia  (*****) and sclerosing adenosis.  4. See comment.     B. Left breast, new margin, resection:   Benign breast tissue. See comment.    C. Left axillary lymph nodes, dissection:    1. Metastatic ductal carcinoma in three of twenty eight lymph nodes  (May 22).  2. Extracapsular extension.   3. Treatment effect.   4. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  5. See comment.      D. Left axillary lymph node, level 3, dissection:   1. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  2. Two of two lymph nodes with no tumor identified (0/2).   3. See comment.    COMMENT:  The partial mastectomy specimen (part A) was extensively sampled.  Sections reveal benign breast tissue with biopsy site changes and  treatment effect. To confirm the diagnosis, immunohistochemical stains  were performed on blocks A11 and A12 at ***** with the following results:  Stain     Target     Result  Keratin     Epithelial cells     Negative for invasive carcinoma (A11  and A12)  P63     Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)  SMM   \n    Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)    The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings and rules against an occult invasive carcinoma in part A.     The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings. Positive staining for ***** along with positive MPO in  histiocytes is compatible with ***** ***** lymphadenitis. Positive  staining for T cell markers without loss of specific markers, favors a  non-neoplastic process. The CD30 stain highlights ***** and  negative staining for CD15 rules against Hodgkin lymphoma. B cell  markers are negative, ruling against a B cell lymphoma. Negative  staining for keratin and CD68 and ***** rules against a histiocytic  process or fulminant treatment effect in the lymph node. Overall, the  findings support a diagnosis of necrotizing lymphadenitis. The  differential diagnosis includes ***** ***** disease, which is  favored, as well as lymphadenitis secondary to systemic lupus  erythematous. Serologic testing for lupus to rule out the diagnosis is  recommended.     ***** ***** is a self-limiting auto-immune disorder which presents  as acute or sub-acute lymphadenitis over the course of several weeks.  The differential diagnosis includes T cell lymphoma, which is largely  excluded in this case by IHC staining as well as lupus which can have  similar ***** (ref 1).

I discussed with ***** in great detail the natural history and treatment of *****-/*****+ breast cancer.  We reviewed the pathology and imaging reports as well as her treatment course to date.  I have stated to ***** that she is at great risk of developing metastatic breast cancer due to her incomplete course of systemic therapy for her high risk disease.  We discussed in detail why she was unable to adhere to the standard treatment as recommended.  She states family members discouraged her from receiving chemotherapy, that she did not feel supported in the management of her symptoms due to her treatment, and that logistically she found it difficult to come in for appointments.      I reiterated to her that she is at great risk of developing metastatic breast cancer which is not curable, and that she can reduce this risk by proceeding with recommended systemic therapy of ***** followed by T-DM1.  I stated that if she were able to commit to this treatment I would do all I and my team can to provide the support she needs to manage symptoms.  I discussed with her the typical SE associated with AC, such as  fatigue, myelosuppression, nausea, hair loss, and brain fog.  Also mentioned risks of cardiomyopathy and secondary leukemia.  Briefly discussed side-effects associated with T-DM1, such as *****, bleeding, and neuropathy.      I reiterated the importance of radiation after \n completing AC.    I have sent ***** a detailed description of AC and the steps that would need to be taken in order to start, including port placement and echocardiogram.  We will aim to speak again this coming week.  ***** states that she will consider this recommendation and also that she understands she is at great risk of MBC.    Recommendations in *****:  - adjuvant AC x 4 cycles, to be followed by T-DM1  - radiation    I spent a total of 80 minutes face-to-face with the patient and >50% of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, symptoms and therapeutic options.  \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

There is involvement of the thoracic spine most severe at T10 where there is involvement of the vertebral body the pedicle and there is intraspinal extension along the right and lateral aspects of the canal. There is involvement of the right pedicle L1 as well.  02/10/18 MRI Lumbar spine w/ and w/o contrast: Abnormal marrow signal with replacement of normal marrow throughout the lumbosacral spine consistent with metastatic infiltration. Sacral tissues are also infiltrated. There is mild fracture of the inferior endplate of L1 on the right side. T12 inferior endplate demonstrates fracture mild loss of height as well. Epidural contrast enhancement ventrally and dorsally consistent with metastases. This is ***** at L5 level. Abnormal replacement of the marrow signal with tumor \n enhancement along the sacral foramina and sacral canal. T12-L1: Areas mild epidural tumor at T12 compressing the thecal sac ventrally.

It is mild dural enhancement. There is mild tumor enhancement posterior to the psoas muscle on the right side at L4. Measures approximately 12 mm. L4-L5: Disc bulge and right sided small disc herniation resulting in right lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis. Mild dural contrast enhancement. L5-S1: There is no central skull tumor. There is epidural thickening. This is extending from S1 segment.  02/10/17 MRI Thoracic spine w/ and w/o contrast: Thoracic metastases throughout the spine. Minimal compression of T6. There is spinal CORD compression due to epidural tumor and thickening from approximately T5-T9. There is separate mild epidural tumor and thecal sac and cord deformity at T12. The epidural enhancement is contiguous throughout the thoracic spine.  02/10/17 MRI Cervical spine w/ and w/o contrast: Heterogeneous marrow signal throughout the cervical spine consistent with metastatic replacement. No epidural tumor. No intraspinal meningeal contrast enhancement.

Extensive bony lytic destructive appearance to the left inferior pubic ramus with subacute/healing fractures suggested. Old right inferior pubic ramus fracture is also seen as well as lytic appearance of the left greater than right acetabulum. Small nondisplaced fracture of the left sacral ala likely pathologic with diffuse osseous metastatic involvement of the sacrum and iliac bones as well as throughout the lumbar vertebral bodies and in multiple ribs. Several healing left and right rib fractures are seen also likely pathologic. Mild degenerative disc disease L4-5.Several endplate compression fracture deformities, for example, inferior endplate compression of T12. Large lytic lesion destroys and replaces much of T10.  02/11/17 bilateral diagnostic mammogram and limited right breast US: The breast tissue is fatty with scattered fibroglandular elements. In the right breast at 12 o'clock middle third, there is a large spiculated mass containing numerous suspicious calcifications.There is diffuse overlying skin thickening as well. No suspicious findings \n are seen in the left breast on mammography. High-resolution ultrasound of the right breast: At 12 o'clock, 2 cm from the nipple, there is a hypoechoic heterogeneous irregularly shaped mass measuring at least 10 x 5 x 7 cm corresponding to mammographic findings and palpable mass. In the right axilla, there is a 25 mm lymph node with thickened cortex that is suspicious for additional metastases.  02/14/17 CT-guided biopsy of the posterior superior left iliac bone: +metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast origin, ER+(76%)/PR+(33%)/*****+ (IHC 3+, no FISH done)  02/14/17 *****-guided biopsy of R breast mass: +IDC, moderately differentiated, ER+(97%)/PR+(79%)/*****+ (IHC 3+/FISH 15.April 10=5.4)  02/18/17: EF 76%  02/18/17 CT A/P due to hypotension and lower extremity weakness: stable compared to 02/11/17 but new left gluteus medius intermuscular hematoma.  02/18/17: new anemia of unclear etiology other than new hematoma (site of bone biopsy)  *****/*****/*****- *****/*****/***** complete 10 fractions (30 Gy) to T spine  02/23/17: start herceptin and ***** (no chemo given due to anemia), start letrozole  03/14/17: second dose herceptin and *****  03/18/17: discharged to ***** *****, *****, ***** for rehab  04/20/17: Consult Dr. ***** (UCSF), only on letrozole at this point, no h/p since *****  05/04/17: start taxotere 75mg/m2 and resume herceptin and *****  *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: admitted locally with severe sepsis, neutropenic fever, n/v  *****/*****: second dose taxotere 75mg/m2, herceptin and *****  *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: admitted locally anemia, mucositis, neutropenic fever, n/v  06/15/17: start taxol 80mg/m2 and continue herceptin and *****  *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: admitted locally with severe sepsis, neutropenic fever, n/v  07/02/17 CT Chest w/ contrast (nothing available for comparison): Previously seen mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy not mentioned.

We discussed that DCIS is a surgical disease. The primary treatment is definitive surgery which she has had. I encouraged to meet with radiation oncology to discuss adjuvant radiation and its benefit in reducing local/regional recurrence. I explained that DCIS can return 50% of the time as another insitu disease and 50% of the time as invasive disease, but technically it should not result in distant recurrence due to lack of invasion. We discussed the role of systemic therapy with tamoxifen. We reviewed the ***** B-24 study that did show a statistically significant reduction in recurrence risk with 5 years of *****, albeit the benefit was small and the side effects are not insignificant. In particular the reduction in invasive disease was 3% with tamoxifen, the remaining benefit in non-invasive disease.  No difference in distant recurrence or survival. We discussed the potential side effects including but not limited to hot flashes, vaginal discharge, headache/migraines, vaginal dryness, mood instability, sexual dysfunction, ovarian cysts, increase in fibroids, impact on uterus including ***** and abnormal vaginal bleeding, as well as small increase risk of endometrial cancer (0.5%) and thrombosis (1-2%). We discussed that she is unable to get pregnant on tamoxifen.     The patient will think about the risk/benefit. I reassured her that her prognosis is excellent. We discussed other lifestyle factors to consider including exercise, healthy BMI <30, reducing etoh.       1. The patient concerns were discussed in detail.

The left breast was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. The hypoechoic  mass at the 6:00 periareolar position was again identified sonographically.  Buffered 1% lidocaine was used for local anesthesia with additional buffered 1%  lidocaine with epinephrine for deep anesthesia. A nick was made in the skin  using 11 blade scalpel.

Assessment and Recommendations:  54 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of a Stage I (*****) *****+/*****- IDC of the right breast, who will benefit from adjuvant radiation and an adjuvant aromatase inhibitor x 5 years.    I discussed with the patient in great detail the natural history and treatment of Stage I HR+/*****- breast cancer.  We reviewed her imaging and pathology reports.  She did not have a *****; it is not clear to me, but \n it is possible that Dr. ***** performed lumpectomy alone because she was thought to have a tubular carcinoma which carries a lower risk?  It is not clear to me what the value of a lymph node biopsy would be at this point, but I will reach out to Dr. ***** to clarify.  Additionally, I noted that it was strange how her biomarkers (on her pathology report) were reported >50% for ER and PR - generally the degree of positivity would be more exact.  I will see if there is a way to speak with her pathologist.  .     I explained that there is a small, but serious risk of distant, metastatic recurrence even after optimal local control, which can be reduced with the addition of anti-estrogen therapy that is given to eradicate micrometastatic deposits of tumor. I explained that the standard, first-line recommendation for adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy in a post-menopausal patient with *****+/*****- breast cancer is an aromatase inhibitor (*****), which blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen, reducing the total body estrogen supply. I discussed the typical side-effects, including hot flashes, arthralgias, vaginal dryness, and bone density loss. I recommend that she take an ***** for at least 5 years.  I stated that she would start this after radiation.    She will need a DEXA to assess her current bone health. We discussed ways to improve her bone health, such as weight bearing exercise. She will also take calcium and vitamin D. We also discussed the importance of aerobic activity (150 minutes a week), which she does appear to currently achieve through daily walking.    Finally, she has not had a breast MRI.  She has extremely dense breast tissue.  We should have a conversation with her breast surgeon about surveillance breast MRI moving forward.    Recommendations in *****:  - proceed with radiation oncology evaluation  - plan to treat with aromatase inhibitor; would check estradiol level  - obtain DEXA  - will speak with Dr. \n ***** about absence of *****  - will see if I can speak with pathologist about ER and PR assessments from her biopsy   - given her father's history of colon cancer and her breast cancer history, would refer for genetic testing  - consider surveillance breast MRI in c/o extreme breast density     I spent a total of 80 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.      \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

Immunohistochemical study results are as follows: ***** shows marked loss  of accompanying myoepithelial cells (only few scattered myoepithelial  cells are seen within and surrounding the papillary lesion); papillary  lesion is positive for ER (100%; strong staining intensity), PR (95%;  strong staining intensity) and negative for *****/***** over-expression  (score of 1+); ki-67 shows a proliferative index of <10% positivity.    Overall, the findings are suspicious for a low-grade intracystic  papillary carcinoma; possible invasive component cannot be ruled out.  Surgical excision of the entire lesion is recommended for complete  pathologic evaluation.      Pt is here with husband for med onc consultation. She notes occ discomfort at surg site.

Standard fixation in ***** ***** is 6-48 hours for all  samples. Fixation time is unknown for samples processed in other  laboratories. A histologic section from the selected tumor block was  reviewed by a pathologist to evaluate tumor and normal tissue  morphology, and an adjacent paraffin section was used for FISH analysis.  That section was ***** with fluorescent probes from the *****  ***** (TM) ***** DNA Probe *****, which includes probes for centromere  17 (*****) and *****. The tumor slide was denatured and subsequently  allowed to hybridize with the ***** (TM) probes. Following  hybridization, the unbound probe was removed by a series of washes, and  the nuclei ***** with DAPI (4, 6 diamidino-2-phenylindole).   Enumeration of ***** and ***** signals was conducted by manual  microscopic examination of cell nuclei using a fluorescence microscope  equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filters. A control  slide with both \n tumor showing ***** amplification and tissue without  amplification demonstrated the appropriate signal patterns.     Educational Note:  According to CAP/***** guidelines, fixed specimens should be fixed in 10%  neutral-buffered formalin for 6-72 hours; specimens fixed in other  solutions or for durations outside this range may perform differently in  this assay. This test utilizes a laboratory modification of the  procedure for the ***** ***** (TM) ***** DNA Probe *****, which is  FDA-approved for the detection of the Her-2/neu ***** via fluorescence in  situ hybridization (FISH). Modifications were validated by the UCSF  Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory to confirm performance  characteristics, in compliance with current guidelines for clinical  implementation.

CLINICAL HISTORY:   70 years old Female with left breast invasive ductal carcinoma with ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.      TECHNIQUE:   Patient's fasting time was > 6 hours.  Following intravenous administration of 10.5 mCi of F18-FDG, a contrast enhanced, diagnostic CT was performed. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 58 minutes after FDG injection.  PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data.  PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction \n was interpreted.  Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images.  Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 117 mg/dL.

We reviewed the data from the ***** ***** which demonstrated ***** postmenopausal women with ER-positive, *****-negative breast cancer who were randomized to receive letrozole plus palbociclib had a median PFS of 24.8 months (compared with 14.5 months in the placebo). The most common adverse events were neutropenia, anemia, and fatigue. We also reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with aromatase inhibitors including but not limited to arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss/fractures, and discussed strategies to mitigate these side effects. She has consented to treatment and thus letrozole has been sent to ***** *****. Palbociclib has been sent to the ***** ***** *****. We discussed potential palbociclib side effects including but not limited to myelosuppression in particular neutropenia requiring count checks every 4 weeks before the start of the next cycle, as well as mucositis, fatigue, n/v, hair thinning, pneumonitis.      Since she has extensive bony mets and new pain, we recommend obtaining new scans and ordered MRI of total spine and CAP CT. We will request her outside PET/CT for comparison. We also discussed that in patients with breast cancer with bone metastases, use of bone modifying agents reduce the risk of skeletal related events. Thus, we recommend initiation of denosumab.We recommend that she have dental clearance prior to its initiation and reviewed potential AEs \n associated with this including *****. We also referred to radiation oncology for consult however her rib and back pain seem migratory and it is not clear if she has a focal site of pain.

Psychiatric:         Mood and Affect: Mood and affect normal.       Assessment:       Nulliparous postmenopausal ***** female who, despite strong family history of breast cancer, negative genetic screen, and relatively low estimates of ever developing breast DCIS or breast cancer, showed progressing ~5cm area of suspicious ***** microcalcifications that, following complete resection, revealed intermediate grade ER+/PR+ DCIS spanning 5cm and including areas of comedo necrosis. I discussed with her Dr. *****'s recommendation that she be evaluated by Rad Onc and Med Onc to consider both adjuvant XRT and endocrine therapy to minimize \n her future risk of recurrent DCIS or progression to invasive ductal cancer over next decade, given her overall excellent health and likelihood of living another 20 years. I informed her that, overall, patients with DCIS may have up to 25-30% recurrence risk which could be reduced to 15% or less if given breast XRT; and that adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex) for 5 years after XRT would further reduce her risk to 5-8% and provide lifelong chemoprotectant benefit for her uninvolved (left) breast. I emphasized that these options would not likely enhance her longevity.  I also pointed out that by the MSKCC nomogram for DCIS recurrence risk, inputting her age and all other features, her 10 year risk might be closer to 15%, but that XRT +/- endocrine therapy would provide significant risk reduction that she should consider further after her pending UCSF Rad Onc consultation. We also discussed the side effects and MSS and bone density complications of aromatase inhibitor therapy given her present diagnosis of osteopenia, and how this latter risk could be mitigated with bisphosphonate therapy.       Plan:       She is inclined toward undertaking additional adjuvant treatment(s) to minimize her risks over the next decade of recurrent DCIS or progression to invasive breast cancer. She understands and looks forward to her ***** evaluation in two weeks which requires her first decision. She will then plan to return for ***** follow-up visit in 3-4 months allowing time to complete right breast XRT if that option is recommended and accepted.         \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

Invasive carcinoma with ductal and lobular \n features, 0.7 cm, *****  grade 2, negative margins; see comment.  3. Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate and high nuclear grades,  mixed solid, comedo and cribriform patterns with ***** and  involvement of lobules, negative margins; see comment.  4. Lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical lobular hyperplasia.  5. Proliferative fibrocystic changes including sclerosing adenosis,  usual ductal hyperplasia, intraductal *****, apocrine metaplasia,  duct ectasia and cysts.  6. ***** change.  7. Biopsy site changes.  8. Microcalcifications associated with ductal carcinoma in situ and  benign ducts.  B. Left axillary sentinel lymph node #1, excision: No tumor in one  lymph node (0/1).  C. Left breast, deep margin, excision: Benign skeletal muscle and  fibroadipose tissue.  D. Left breast, anterior margin over DCIS, excision: Benign  fibroadipose tissue.     Assessment and Plan:  ***** ***** ***** is a 63 y.o. female with ***** +/ ***** negative invasive carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. We reviewed her work-up to date and her pathology result. I explained that her cancer is low risk and I do not recommend adjuvant chemotherapy. Because her breast cancer is strongly estrogen receptor positive, we discussed beginning an endocrine based therapy, specifically letrozole. She understands that she will receive at least five years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.     In terms of hormonal therapy, I explained that aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have improved outcomes in terms of DFS as compared to tamoxifen. I also discussed the data from ***** and ***** which demonstrated modest benefit of extending hormonal therapy beyond 5 years. I explained that the decision to continue the aromatase inhibitor beyond 5 years should be an individualized decision based on the patient's risk and tolerance of hormonal therapy.    I reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with an \n aromatase inhibitors including arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss. I explained that the joint pains are often the most difficult side effect to manage, and not infrequently, patients will switch to another aromatase inhibitor, and if not able to tolerate, we will consider switching to a different ***** or tamoxifen.    I have ordered a base line DEXA. We briefly discussed the role of bone targeted therapies. We will have a more in depth discussion of these therapies once she is further along in treatment. In the interim, I encouraged her to maintain a calcium rich diet, take in an adequate amount of Vitamin D (typically at least *****-***** ***** per day in a post-menopausal patient without much sun exposure) and engage in weight bearing exercise.  I  encouraged exercise to meet the goal of 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week since this has been associated with improvement in breast cancer specific and overall survival among breast cancer patients.      F/U: 3 months     Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects, clinical trials, and follow up plan were reviewed  in detail.

In January 2007 patient underwent fine-needle aspiration that revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.  03/29/2007 the patient underwent a right lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy revealing a 3.5 cm invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive, and HER-2/neu. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive and therefore the patient underwent a full axillary lymph node dissection on 04/12/2007 revealing April 07 lymph nodes positive.  The patient received 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 4 cycles of Taxotere.  January 2008 the patient completed radiation to the right breast.  March 2008 the patient started adjuvant tamoxifen.  However she had a CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis that revealed an abnormality in the left breast.  08/23/2008 the patient underwent an MRI of bilateral breasts revealing a 12 mm mass in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast.  10/11/2008 the patient underwent left breast mammogram revealing a \n suspicious mass in the left breast.  10/30/2008 the patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration that revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  12/18/2008 the patient underwent a left breast lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 1.5 cm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2 negative by immunohistochemistry.  One out of the 3 sentinel lymph nodes was positive.  In December 2008 the patient had a completion axillary lymph node dissection and only 2 lymph nodes were seen both negative for cancer.  In January 2009, the patient initiated chemotherapy with Cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-*****.  She also started Lupron at this time.  The patient underwent genetic testing and was negative for BRCA1 and 2.  08/27/2009 the patient underwent a CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis revealing enhancing tissue in the right anterior breast, a sclerotic focus in the left sacral ala, and a new sclerotic focus in the right anterior superior acetabulum. A bone scan on 09/04/2009 revealed no uptake to suggest osseous metastasis.  09/12/2009 the patient initiated postoperative radiation to the left breast, supraclavicular, and axillary regions receiving 1800 cGY to these regions.  09/20/2009, the patient underwent a core biopsy of a mass in the 12:00 position of the right breast which revealed a grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma.  11/08/2009, the patient underwent a PET CT scan at ***** revealing skin thickening in the right breast, a 1.1 cm area of soft tissue enhancement in the right breast, no axillary or internal mammary adenopathy, and no clear evidence of distant metastatic disease.  12/14/2009 the patient underwent bilateral mastectomies, bilateral ***** flap reconstruction, and a left completion axillary \n dissection. Pathology from the left breast revealed no cancer, and 0/8 axillary lymph nodes contained metastatic cancer.  However in the right breast mastectomy specimen, there was was 2 cm of grade 1 invasive ductal cancer.  0 of 6 lymph nodes removed contained cancer on the right side.  The invasive cancer was again estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  November 2009 the patient initiated letrozole.  October 2010 the patient began to experience some lightheadedness when standing.  She then developed more severe headaches.  Finally she noted a lump in the left side of her neck.  12/06/2010 the patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration of a left supraclavicular lymph node which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma which was very weakly estrogen receptor positive with only 1-5% of the cells staining, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  12/11/2010 the patient underwent a PET CT scan which revealed a new right frontal dural based metastasis with SUV of 28.2 with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect.  The scan also revealed multiple hypermetabolic left cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  There was hypermetabolism along the right parasternal chest wall consistent with recurrent disease possibly invading the sternum.  There was also bilateral subpectoral lymphadenopathy with maximum SUV of 11.4 on the left and 4.1 on the right.  There was an area of focal hypermetabolism in the hepatic segment ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** a maximum SUV of 7.0 suspicious for early hepatic metastasis.  There was multifocal osseous metastatic disease identified within the C2, L2 vertebral bodies as well as in the sacrum.  12/11/2010 the patient underwent an MRI of the brain which revealed a 4 cm left inferior frontal extra-axial mass new since 11/08/2009.  Patient met with radiation oncology as \n well as neurosurgery to discuss treatment options.  12/30/2010 the patient underwent resection of the frontal brain metastasis.  Pathology confirmed that it was consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast primary, and was estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  02/10/2011 - Whole brain RT: 30 gray in 10 fractions  03/01/2011 - Started Xeloda 4000mg (actually took 2000mg) daily 14 days on 7 days off  03/12/2011 - PET/CT (during cycle 1 Xeloda) with PD including liver, bones, LNs, breast.

I discussed with the patient the natural history and treatment of Stage ***** *****+/*****- breast cancer.  We reviewed her pathology and imaging reports.  I explained that there is a small, but serious risk of distant, metastatic recurrence even after optimal local control, which can be reduced with the addition of anti-estrogen therapy that is given to eradicate micrometastatic deposits of tumor. I explained that the standard, first-line recommendation for adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy in a post-menopausal patient with *****+/*****- breast cancer is an aromatase inhibitor (*****), which blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen, reducing the total body estrogen supply. I discussed the typical side-effects, including hot flashes, arthralgias, vaginal dryness, and bone density loss. I recommend that she take an ***** for at least 5 years.     She will need a DEXA at this time to assess her current bone health. We discussed ways to improve her bone health, such as weight bearing exercise. She will also take calcium and \n vitamin D. We also discussed the importance of aerobic activity (150 minutes a week).    I expect that she will proceed with radiation.  We will plan on meeting again once her radiation course is complete to review DEXA and plan her ***** start.  She stated clear understanding and was in agreement with this plan.       Recommendations in *****:  - proceed with radiation oncology consultation; ***** ***** she will have radiation  - obtain DEXA   - calcium/vitamin D  - aim to resume her daily aerobic activities    RTC after radiation course is completed    I spent a total of 90 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.  \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

Imaging results reviewed and discussed with patient:         03/17/2019 BREAST MRI  MRI Findings:  Overall breast composition: The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue. The background parenchymal enhancement is mild.    RIGHT Breast:  1) There is a irregularly shaped mass with spiculated margins and heterogeneous internal enhancement in the right breast, upper OUTER quadrant measuring 12 x 11 x 14 mm (best seen on axial T1 post-contrast image 99/***** and ***** image *****/*****). This mass demonstrates marked T2 hyperintensity. Kinetic curve assessment demonstrates predominately fast initial and delayed washout enhancement pattern.    2) Additional satellite masses are seen, for example within the upper INNER quadrant measuring 4 x 7 x 7 mm mass, best seen on axial T1 post-contrast image 118/*****, ***** image *****/*****). This mass is in close approximation to the skin surface, and is likely the sampled lesion performed out outside institution in *****. Kinetic curve assessment demonstrates predominately fast initial and delayed washout enhancement pattern.    3) Additional ***** mass is seen inferior to \n the dominant upper OUTER mass, measuring 7 x 6 x 6 mm (best seen on axial T1 post contrast image 141/*****, ***** image *****/*****). Kinetic curve assessment demonstrates predominately fast initial and delayed washout enhancement pattern.    4)  Stippled non-mass ***** is seen surrounding the mass and ***** masses with overall extent of non-mass enhancement and masses measuring approximately 5 cm as measured on post-contrast MIPs.    LEFT Breast:  No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified.    OTHER:  The axillae and visualized chest are unremarkable.    IMPRESSION:   Right breast: Suspicious (BI-RADS 4).  Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1).    Recommendations:  ***** mass in the upper OUTER quadrant of the right breast with ***** masses and surrounding NME ***** a majority of the upper outer quadrant extending into the upper INNER quadrant of the right breast at site of known skin -associated cancer. Recommend continued surgical and oncologic management of patient's known right breast IDC. As the skin-associated mass within the upper inner quadrant was previously sampled at the outside institution, recommend second look ultrasound and possible biopsy of the dominant mass within the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.

For Parts B to D, the specimens are inked, and the margins are  microscopically evaluated.         03/21/19 ***** ***** Amplification Testing by FISH  LABORATORY PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATION:  Negative: Tumor cells showing no amplification of ***** (ERBB2).    *****          Assessment and Plan:  ***** *****-***** is a 59 y.o. female with a recently diagnosed multifocal grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma (ER+/PR+/*****-) with a single ***** in a sentinel node. Her tumor was found to have a ***** Low Risk profile.    Today we discussed her diagnosis of early stage breast cancer and the role of \n adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. She understands that she will need to undergo re-excision for the margin positive for non-invasive cancer and she also understands the role of post-lumpectomy radiation. She has met with Dr. ***** in ***** *****.    *****. ***** reviewed the meaning of the ***** result and described the data for use of ***** as both a prognostic and predictive tool. We explained the published results form the ***** trial which demonstrated that patients who have clinical higher risk cancers based on traditional measures including tumor size, grade and lymph node status, but whose tumors have a ***** Low Risk profile have an excellent prognosis at 5 years even in the absence of chemotherapy, and chemotherapy offers very little benefit for these patient. Given this is *****'s situation, Dr. ***** does not recommend chemotherapy.    In terms of hormonal therapy, we explained that aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have improved outcomes in terms of DFS as compared to tamoxifen. The decision regarding continuing hormone therapy for 5 versus 10 years will be considered later and will largely depend on *****'s tolerance of hormonal therapy.    We reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with an aromatase inhibitors including arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss. We explained that the joint pains are often the most difficult side effect to manage, and not infrequently, patients will switch to another aromatase inhibitor, and if not able to tolerate, we will consider switching to tamoxifen.     In regards to efficacy, there are three AIs and all are equivalent,  although some patients tolerate one better than another. Therefore, we will recommend she start letrozole 2.5mg PO daily.    We discussed that while on hormone therapy, she should undergo assessment for bone health, specifically a bone density scan. \n Her last bone density scan was >10 years ago. This repeat scan can happen In September when she returns for surgery. If her scan ***** any osteopenia, we will discuss starting a bisphosphonate (favoring PO). She should also take  vitamin D and calcium in the meantime. She already incorporates 20-30 minutes of moderate to high intensity exercise daily.     Lastly, we also discussed management of vaginal atrophy as a side effect of hormone therapy, including the use of nonhormonal vaginal moisturizers including ***** (which she currently uses). We will continue to discuss management of the above upon her return in September.    Due to her work schedule abroad, she is deciding how to best sequence her upcoming treatment. She has discussed with Dr. ***** that ideally she will allow 3 months to allow the lumpectomy cavity to heal, and during this time, she can initiate hormonal therapy. This ***** well with her travel plans, and she was already planning on taking home leave in late August/early September for her daughter's college graduation. Therefore, she will start letrozole now and likely return in September for her surgery. She may pursue RT closer to home in *****, and will also likely establish her long-term oncology follow up closer to home (New ***** or *****) as well.    In regards to her radiation therapy plan, she is at risk for local recurrence in her right breast for which ***** is recommending additional radiation. Given her surgical pathology with only micrometastatic disease in her sentinel lymph node, they are not recommending adjuvant radiation to her regional lymph nodes.    Plan:    1. Start letrozole 2.5mg PO daily now (prescription sent)  2. Calcium supplementation with  1200mg/day combination of diet and supplement. ***** recommend vit D supplement pending *****-***** ***** ***** ***** today  3. Bone density scan can be completed when she returns from *****  4. ental eval and clearance if considering \n bisphosphonate pending bone scan result  5. Surgical planning per Dr. *****, tentatively scheduled for September 2019  6. RT planning per *****, likely pursued locally in *****    2. Urogenital atrophy prevention  - Continue use of vaginal moisturizer. (ie *****). Can also try coconut oil and/or *****, and will discuss vaginal estrogens at future visit.

FINDINGS:    Brain: Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. No mass effect. While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated.    Neck: No hypermetabolic neck masses or lymphadenopathy.    Chest: Large, enhancing, hypermetabolic right breast mass measuring approximately 9.0 x 3.8 cm in axial dimensions (series 2, image 127) with maximum SUV 7.8. At least 2 mildly hypermetabolic right \n axillary lymph nodes measuring 6 mm and 7 mm (series 2, image 107) with maximum SUV 1.8. Additionally, there is an enhancing, hypermetabolic 7 mm ***** (in the subcutaneous fat of the right chest wall) lymph node (series 2, image 95) with maximum SUV 2.9.    Multiple coronary artery calcifications. Tiny calcified pulmonary nodules, likely sequela of prior granulomatous disease.    Abdomen/Pelvis: Nonspecific 6 mm hypodensity in hepatic segment 3 (series 2, image 172), too small to characterize but likely benign; attention on follow-up. Nonspecific 8 mm splenic hypodensity (series 2, image 164) but likely benign; attention on follow-up. No hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy.    Musculoskeletal: FDG uptake at the level of the coccyx (maximum SUV 5.0). Given the location, highly likely to be inflammatory or posttraumatic. No definite metastatic lesions.    IMPRESSION:     1. Large, enhancing hypermetabolic right breast mass measuring approximately 9.0 cm in maximal dimension, suggesting disease recurrence. Please see MR breast 12/11/2016 for further details.    2. Enhancing hypermetabolic right axillary and right subcutaneous lymph nodes, suggesting nodal involvement.    3. FDG uptake at the level of the coccyx is favored to be inflammatory or posttraumatic. Recommend correlation and attention on follow-up.    This study was reviewed by attendings Dr. ***** ***** from ***** ***** and Dr. ***** *****. ***** of Nuclear Medicine.    END OF IMPRESSION    Assessment and Recommendations:  64 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a clinical stage II-III *****-/*****+ IDC of the right breast who should proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    We reviewed the available imaging and pathology reports.  We discussed her original DCIS diagnosis from 2007 as well as a second biopsy in 2013 that was concerning for microinvasive disease; she did not undergo conventional therapy at the time of her original diagnoses.  I \n explained to her that she now had clear evidence of invasive breast cancer, but noted that her PET/CT demonstrated no evidence of metastases and therefore she can now be treated with curative intent.  I discussed with ***** and her husband in great detail the natural history and treatment of early stage *****-/*****+ IDC.  I explained that were she to forego the recommended therapy, I am very concerned that she would develop metastatic disease in the short term, even in the context of her 10 year history of DCIS.    We discussed the multimodality approach to breast cancer treatment. The patient understands that her treatment recommendations will include chemotherapy, biological therapies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), surgery, and radiation. We discussed the advantages of offering chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in order to increase the chances of breast conserving surgery, while concurrently allowing us to assess the response to treatment.  I explained that in the context of her high-risk node-negative, ***** positive disease we would typically recommend that she receive either 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel plus trastuzumab/pertuzumab (THP) followed by 4 cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) every 2 weeks or 6 cycles of every 3 week docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (TCHP).  I also explained that either regimen would be followed by every 3 week trastuzumab for a total of one year of biological therapy.     We reviewed the potential side effects of both regimens.  Given her extensive disease even in the absence of nodal involvement, I recommend that she proceed with an anthracycline-containing regimen, unless she is found to have substantial cardiac dysfunction on TTE.  I specifically discussed with ***** the typical and less common side-effects associated with THP/AC, such as: fatigue, nausea, myelosuppression, nail changes, alopecia, diarrhea, and constipation. I stated that \n with regards to trastuzumab, she is at risk of a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, which can result in asymptomatic or symptomatic heart failure with dyspnea and chest pain.  I stated that pertuzumab is associated with diarrhea and rash.  We additionally discussed the rare adverse events associated with THP/AC, both secondary leukemia and cardiomyopathy.      After an extensive discussion, the patient completely understands the rationale for neoadjuvant treatment and will spend the weekend considering where she wants to proceed with her therapy.  I explained to her that I would recommend she start her treatment within 2 to 3 weeks.  She would need a TTE, Mediport placement, and if treated here at *****, a chemotherapy teaching session.    The patient will contact me after the weekend and let me know whether she plans to proceed with treatment here at ***** or elsewhere, closer to home.    I spent a total of 120 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 115 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, the risks and benefits of surgery, symptoms and therapeutic options.    \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

PET/CT and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed on 10/30/2017 could not be retrieved for direct comparison at the time   of dictation.     HISTORY: 64-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer. Restaging.     TECHNIQUE:     PET/CT: Overnight fast. F-18 FDG, 14.8 mCi right antecubital. Appropriate delay. Skull base to mid thighs PET-CT. Images (multiplanar - axial/coronal/sagittal) at computer display, with and without attenuation correction, static and cinematic,   qualitative and quantitative. Low-dose CT for PET attenuation correction yields limited anatomic images. Fusion imaging. Please note that ***** ***** component of this PET-CT exam was performed, as standard, with shallow breathing (to match PET). Interval   post injection was 60 minutes. Blood glucose was 109 mg/dL.      *****: 4.90 mGy and DLP: 440 mGy-cm.     CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed following the intravenous administration of 100 mL of Omnipaque 300. 0 mL discarded.     *****: 9.00 mGy and DLP: 265 mGy-cm.     *****: 6.07 mGy and DLP: 282 mGy-cm.     CT dose reduction technique utilized with one of more of the following: Automated exposure control and/***** of the mA and/or kV according to patient size and/or use of iterative reconstruction technique.     FINDINGS:     SKELETAL: Again noted are numerous sclerotic and mixed lytic sclerotic osseous metastases throughout the skeleton, increasing in ***** uptake and number when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021, interpreted as osseous disease progression. For   example, a peripherally sclerotic osseous metastasis in the left lesser trochanter of the femur now measures a maximal SUV of 3.0, previously measuring a maximal SUV of 1.7, without overlying cortical disruption nor superimposed pathological fracture at this time. A mixed lytic sclerotic osseous metastasis in the anterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body now \n measures a maximal SUV of 5.2, previously measuring a maximal SUV of 3.4. A sclerotic osseous metastasis in the right aspect of the T7 vertebral body now measures a maximal SUV of 3.1, previously measuring a maximal SUV of 2.7. An FDG avid faintly sclerotic osseous metastasis in the left scapula measures a maximal SUV of 2.6 (image 65), new when compared to prior.     No vertebral body compression fractures. Degenerative changes are noted in the spine, again noting underlying degenerative disc disease is noted at L5-S1 with intervertebral disc space narrowing and degenerative endplate changes.     HEAD/NECK: No suspicious FDG avid neck masses nor cervical lymphadenopathy.     There is a focal region of apparent increased FDG uptake in the visualized portion of the right frontal lobe (image 1), incompletely characterized on this study. Chronic deformity of the right lamina ***** is noted. A mucous retention cyst is noted   in the left maxillary sinus. The remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.     CHEST: There is no suspicious focus of increased FDG uptake in the chest. There is no FDG avid lymphadenopathy within the chest. No enlarging lymph nodes are identified in the chest.     The central airways are patent. No FDG avid pulmonary nodules or masses. Underlying emphysematous changes. No pleural effusions.     There is a right-sided chest port with the tip terminating in the distal SVC. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber. The heart size is within normal limits. No pericardial effusions. Small hiatal hernia.     ABDOMEN/PELVIS: Numerous FDG avid hepatic metastases have increased in size and FDG uptake when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021. For example, a hepatic metastasis in the left hepatic lobe now measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm with a maximal SUV of 6.7   (image 141), previously measuring 1.9 x 1.5 cm with a maximum SUV of 5.0 . A hepatic metastasis \n adjacent to the falciform ligament measures approximately 3.5 x 2.1 cm with a maximal SUV of 6.2 (image 135), previously measuring 2.9 x 1.9 cm with a   maximal SUV of 4.5. An FDG avid hepatic metastasis in the central aspect of the liver measures 1.9 x 1.8 cm with a maximal SUV of 5.8 (image 125), previously measuring 1.0 x 0.9 cm with a maximal SUV of 3.5.     The hepatic veins, portal veins, splenic vein, and SMV are patent. The gallbladder is grossly unremarkable. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The pancreas is unremarkable. The spleen is unremarkable.     No FDG avid adrenal masses.Symmetric renal enhancement. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. Urinary bladder is grossly unremarkable. The uterus is absent.     There is prominent intraluminal FDG uptake in the anorectal region measuring a maximal SUV of 5.9, previously measuring a maximal SUV of 7.3, without underlying discernible CT correlate, nonspecific. The visualized bowel is normal in caliber without   evidence of obstruction. There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum. A normal appendix is seen. Vascular calcifications are noted in a normal caliber abdominal aorta.     IMPRESSION:   IMPRESSION:     1. Progression of metastatic disease when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021. Numerous FDG avid hepatic metastases have increased in size and FDG uptake when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021.     2. Numerous FDG avid skeletal metastases throughout the skeleton have increased in ***** uptake and number when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021.     3. Focal region of apparent increased FDG uptake in the visualized portion of the right frontal lobe, incompletely characterized on this study, which could potentially be *****, however, further evaluation with MRI of the brain is recommended to   exclude the possibility of an intracranial metastasis.     4. Persistent prominent \n intraluminal uptake in the anorectal region, nonspecific, potentially physiologic or inflammatory in etiology. An underlying polyp would not be excluded.

The patient's blood pressure was 144 mmHg/78 mmHg during the study. The heart rate during the study was 74. Color Flow Doppler was utilized for this exam. Spectral Doppler was utilized for this exam.  1. The left ventricular volume is normal. LV function is normal. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 55 to 60%. There is no left ventricular hypertrophy. No segmental wall motion abnormalities \n present.  2. The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal.  3. Left atrial size is normal. Right atrial size is normal.  4. There is no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  5. There is no Doppler evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction.  6. The RV systolic pressure is at least 19 mmHg based on a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to the lack of a complete ***** jet.  7. No pericardial effusion noted. The inferior vena cava is less than 21 mm in diameter and collapses with inspiration consistent with a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  8. Aortic root dimension is normal.                  Previous Comparison:  No previous study is available for comparison.       Cardiac *****:  Left Ventricle: The left ventricular volume is normal. LV function is normal. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 55 to 60%. 3 view global longitudinal strain is minus 17.9 % which is in the normal range (-17 to -22). There is no left ventricular   hypertrophy. No segmental wall motion abnormalities present.  LV Diastolic Function: There is no Doppler evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction. Doppler tissue imaging suggests normal left sided filling pressures with an E/E' of 5.  Right Ventricle: The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal. RV S' velocity is 13 cm/s.  Left Atrium:Left atrial size is normal.  Right Atrium:Right atrial size is normal.  Cardiac output: Doppler findings are consistent with a normal cardiac output.

Trace / physiologic mitral regurgitation is present.  Tricuspid Valve: Tricuspid valve anatomy and motion are normal. There is trace tricuspid regurgitation.  Pulmonic Valve: The pulmonary valve is not well \n seen. There is no pulmonic regurgitation.     Other:  Pulmonary Artery and Right Sided Pressures: The pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to the lack of a complete ***** jet. The RV systolic pressure is at least 19 mmHg based on a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  Aorta: Aortic root dimension is normal. The ascending aorta appears normal in size.  Pericardium: Prominent epicardial fat pad noted. No pericardial effusion noted.  IVC and Hepatic Veins: The inferior vena cava is less than 21 mm in diameter and collapses with inspiration consistent with a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.

She did enjoy an 8 year disease-free interval but the current local relapse ***** a high risk of future relapse and mortality from this disease.    The benefit of chemotherapy in reducing her recurrence risk and mortality was reviewed. This was the subject of the CALOR study which showed that adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of local recurrences benefits ***** with ER negative disease, but does not benefit patients with ER positive disease (***** ***** *****). I don't think ***** will benefit from chemotherapy at this point.    ***** will benefit from the resumption of hormonal therapy. Her recurrence did occur a year after stopping anastrozole against medical advice, so potentially this disease remains ***** sensitive. On the other hand, the disease is naive to tamoxifen and this may be a more effective option in this case, specially considering the possibility of *****-resistant clonal ***** mutations that may have arisen during the years of ***** therapy. Side effects of tamoxifen were discussed including the potential for thromboembolic phenomenon including DVT and PE and endometrial cancers.     ***** has had two local recurrences and will benefit from chest wall RT.

The patient says that prior to March \n of 2011 she had no gastrointestinal complaints whatsoever.  She had no abdominal pain, no change in bowel habit, no nausea or vomiting.  The patient was given a course of prednisone and antibiotics for a sinus infection, and following this for her abdominal complaints started.  She says that on balance her complaints are a bit better.  She still has abdominal gas and bloating, and some irregularity of bowel habit and recurrent nausea.  However she denies any recent episodes of severe cramping abdominal pain at least for the last one to 2 months.  Despite the symptoms the patient has not lost any significant amount of weight.  She has not had any vomiting of blood or rectal bleeding.  She denies any fevers or chills.  The patient had a colonoscopy in 2010 soon before the onset of the symptoms and that was normal by her report.  She was seen by her primary physician and Dr. ***** for these complaints, and no significant abnormalities were found during their evaluation.  By her report she had routine laboratory studies including a celiac antibody profile was normal.  She also underwent an upper endoscopy with biopsy throughout the upper GI tract and was only notable for a slight increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes found on the duodenal biopsy but otherwise was a normal exam.  The patient has been treated with dexilant for the past few months, she is uncertain if this medication has made much of a difference.

She was responding to chemotherapy but now the breast cancer is palpable again.  We discussed using some other IV treatment for shrinking the tumor and she declines to do anything prior to surgery.      She reports with \n chemotherapy she had poor night vision , could not think, premature menopause.  She has severe pain in the breast.  she wants to change to me of ongoing treatment.  She reports feeling  poor exercise tolerance.      We discussed olaparib and xeloda.  We discussed the importance of exercise to help her recover from toxicity of chemotherapy.

She plans a bilateral mastectomy with left ***** surgery is planned for January 31.  Her tumor is enlarging.   4. She will qualify for adjuvant xeloda.  Could consider ***** concurrently.   5.  We discussed the role of surgery and radiation to decrease the risk of local recurrence.  6.  We discussed the role of hormonal blockade to decrease the risk of systemic recurrence. Her tumor is barely positive for PR 15% but will offer it per guidelines.   7.   We discussed the role of chemotherapy to decrease the risk of systemic recurrence. Unfortunately she did not complete primary treatment and now has had a hiatus between chemotherapy and surgery and her tumor is growing again.  I discussed further chemotherapy and she refuses.  She will qualify for xeloda and olaparib.  We could consider *****.    8.  We discussed lifestyle modifications to decrease the risk of recurrence as well as primary cancer risk reduction.  I recommend an anti inflammatory and /or diabetes risk reducing diet , limiting alcohol, exercise, stress reduction and sleep management.     9.

Comparison: Prior examination dated 03/16/2018 (MRI) was reviewed for comparison. Ultrasound Findings: In the region of clinical concern there is no evidence of drainable fluid collection or mass.  Subcutaneous edema is present.  There is trace fluid about the tissue expander and along the tract of the recently removed drain.     Left breast: Benign (BI-RADS 2). Recommendations: Recommend continued surgical and oncologic management in this post-operative patient. ***** ***** *****, MD     Assessment and Plan:  ***** ***** is a 32 y.o. female ATM mutation carrier with a clinical ***** *****+/PR-/***** negative left breast. Subsequent to our clinic visit, the patient underwent a second FNA of the left axillary LNs and it again showed no cancer. Because of her ATM mutation, radiation oncology has recommended that she proceed with mastectomy rather than breast conserving surgery. ***** underwent bilateral mastectomy on 04/11/18 with Dr ***** and was found to have a 3 cm grade 3 IDC in the left breast with March 09 SLN involved by micrometastasis.     1. Breast Cancer: At a previous visit, we had a a detailed discussion with ***** and her family members about the recent surgery and the findings of her pathology report. She has decided to proceed with AC-Taxol.    I explained to ***** that at ***** we tend to offer ***** Taxol for 12 weeks FOLLOWED by AC over dose dense AC-Taxol as it is better tolerated when patients start with the taxane and it will be better for her quality of life. I informed her that the efficacy of the treatment does not change regardless of the order, \n and that one retrospective study from ***** suggests that giving the taxane first may actually improve outcomes.    We again reviewed the risks of chemotherapy and explained that she will likely have some form of educational meeting to discuss side effect management further with Dr. *****'s staff.    After completion of chemotherapy I will recommend ovarian suppression with an aromatase inhibitor and she may also be eligible for the ***** trial (with ribociclib).      2. Symptom Management:  While we do support the use of medical marijuana, I advised against smoking raw ***** because of the possibility of introducing carcinogens but she has the option of using vape pens or ***** to help manage nausea and other symptoms    I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 45 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 35 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, medication risks, lifestyle modification and therapeutic options.

She had bilateral ***** with left breast SLN biopsy on 10/07/18. Pathology revealed 1 cm of residual ER+/PR-/*****- grade 2 IDC with a 0.***** ***** in July 18 ***** removed.      1. Breast cancer: ***** \n continues to recover from surgery. She met with Dr. ***** in radiation oncology today and elected to enrolled on a clinic trial, which will randomized her to 3 vs 5 weeks of radiation. Tentative start date is 12/16/18. We discussed the role of endocrine therapy today. She start an aromatase inhibitor after she completes radiation. She has decided to proceed with a bilateral oophorectomy with Dr. *****, so she may not require ovarian suppression. Dr. ***** also discussed she may be eligible for the ***** trial with ribociclib that should open around the time she completes radiation.    2. Pulmonary nodule: Baseline PET/CT in April 2018 showed a non-specific 4 mm pulmonary nodule. Her CT Chest in August 2018 was stable. Consider a follow up CT Chest in one year.     3. Low weight, improved: We encouraged her to continue efforts to gain weight. Continue small, frequent meals a day and Ensure protein shakes. Continue to trend weight. Follow up with nutrition on 11/30/18.    4. Anxiety: She continues to struggle with anxiety though she states this is slightly improved. Encouraged her to follow up with her local therapist. She was prescribed Lexapro previously but has not taken it.    5. BRCA1 mutation: S/p bilateral mastectomy. She will see Dr. ***** on 12/02/18 to discuss bilateral oophorectomy.     6. Pain in neck and back and limited ROM in bilateral arms: Referred to PT.     Follow up on 01/05/19       This is a shared visit for services provided by me, ***** ***** *****, MD. I performed a face-to-face encounter with the patient and the following portion of the note is my own.     I have reviewed the history and participated in the physical exam and assessment and plan as documented.    Additional A/P: ***** looks a little stronger today and has gained a few pounds. Per the NP note, ***** will undergo a BSO eventually, but depending on timing, she may not need OS if she does not recover ovarian \n function before then. We will submit authorization for her to get Zoladex here in the event that there is a delay in her oophorectomy.

Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of right breast in female,   estrogen receptor positive (CMS code)     Overview      10/11/20: Presented to the ED with abdominal discomfort, bloating and   indigestion. CT/AP showed 12.3 cm x 19.6 cm x 20.6 ***** mass of   suspected ovarian origin for which she was referred to ***** *****.   11/14/20: Underwent exploratory laparotomy, *****-BSO, pelvic washings as   well as biopsy of a R breast mass (***** reported lump prior to   surgery).  *****-BSO specimens consistent with leiomyomas and adenomyosis,   no evidence of malignancy. Pelvic washing negative. In the OR underwent   core biopsy of the palpable breast mass.     Breast onc history:    11/14/2020: Surgical pathology from intra-op R breast biopsy -  IDC,   modified ***** grade 2,  ER+ (98%), PR +(25%), ***** IHC 2+, FISH negative,   ***** 5%     11/11/2020: CT chest with two solid 0.2 cm pulmonary nodules in R middle   and lower lobes, mildly enlarged R axillary lymph nodes and enlarged (1.3   cm) retroperitoneal lymph nodes    12/10/2020: Bilateral diagnostic mammography with tomosynthesis, limited   right breast ultrasound. Mammogram found there is an irregular spiculated   mass with associated fine pleomorphic microcalcifications in the right   breast, upper inner quadrant, anterior third. No mammographic features of   malignancy in the left breast. Ultrasound demonstrated a 38 x 27 x 16 mm   hypoechoic, irregularly shaped solid mass with spiculated margins, in the \n   right breast, upper inner quadrant, 1:00, 1 cm from nipple. Right axilla   demonstrated several enlarged lymph nodes with cortical thickening   measuring up to 4 mm. There is an 11 x 11 x 9 mm right axillary node with   irregular shape and indistinct margins, suspicious for extranodal disease   extension.    12/10/2020 FNA of enlarged R axillary node consistent with metastatic   carcinoma    12/23/2020 MRI breast:  1. A 38 mm right upper inner quadrant breast mass corresponds to proven   malignancy. No evidence of multifocal disease or contralateral   malignancy. Recommend continued surgical and oncologic management.  2. Right level April 26 axillary adenopathy corresponds to proven metastatic   disease.  3. Nonspecific 5 mm enhancing lesion within the right upper sternum,   without apparent correlate on ***** ***** of 11/11/2020. Recommend   correlation with bone scan or PET/CT.  4. Suggestion of enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, which appear   more prominent in comparison to the prior CT of 11/11/20, although   comparison is limited due to differences in technique. Suggest   correlation with CT or PET/CT.    12/31/20 PET/CT: 1. Baseline PET/CT demonstrates hypermetabolic right breast   mass consistent with known invasive ductal carcinoma. Associated   hypermetabolic right axillary, right internal mammary, and possible right   anterior chest wall metastases.  Additional extensive fat stranding along   the right upper extremity neurovascular bundle raises the possibility of   brachial plexus involvement.   2.  Extensive hypermetabolic bilateral hilar and mediastinal   lymphadenopathy in a pattern most suggestive of sarcoidosis versus less   likely metastatic disease.   3.  *****-shaped hypodensities within the left greater than right kidneys,   favoring pyelonephritis versus less likely developing infarcts. Mild   circumferential urinary bladder wall thickening also may reflect urinary   tract infection. \n Recommend correlation with urinalysis and symptoms.  4.  Postsurgical changes from hysterectomy and bilateral   salpingo-oophorectomy. Associated hypodensity within the right ovarian   vein favored to represent thrombus versus less likely mixing artifact.    01/07/21 Renal/kidney u/s: Normal size bilateral kidneys. No hydronephrosis   or renal calculus noted. Of note, targeted Doppler interrogation   demonstrates region with relative decreased vascularity at the left lower   pole, corresponding to the site of ***** on ***** ***** scan.   Adjacent to this, a small round focus with abnormal turbulent pulsatile   flow is demonstrated.    01/08/21 CT angiogram abdomen: Left inferior renal artery vascular   irregularity with associated inferior pole hypoperfusion, likely   representing partially thrombosed dissection with aneurysm versus   pseudoaneurysm measuring up to 0.6 cm, not definitively seen on 10/11/2020   examination. Left hepatic lobe irregular 1.5 cm hypodensity, incompletely   characterized. Right middle lobe peripheral 0.4 cm lesion, increased in   prominence compared to 11/11/2020. Total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral   salpingo-oophorectomy postsurgical changes with associated distal right   ovarian vein thrombosis. Prominent but not pathologically enlarged   periaortic lymph nodes.     01/09/21 Endobronchial biopsy: Benign bronchial tissue.  FNA: A.  Lymph node, station 11R, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine   needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:  B.  Lymph node, station 7, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:  C.  Lymph node, station 11L, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:    01/09/21 Invitae genetic testing: Pathogenic variant in *****. Variant of   uncertain significance in \n WRN      01/14/21 ***** abdomen: 1.  No MRI correlate to the previously described 1.5   cm hypodensity within the left hepatic lobe. The previously described   vascular irregularity of the left inferior renal artery is seen, but   better characterized on prior CTA exam.    01/20/21 start neoadjuvant taxol ***** followed by *****    06/02/21 ***** *****: RIGHT Breast: Interval decrease in volume, extent and   avidity of enhancement of the known right upper inner malignancy with   residual segmental non-mass enhancement measuring up to 28 x 10 x 25 mm   (AP x trans x CC extent) on MIP images (previously measuring up to 38 x 14   x 29 mm).   Kinetic evaluation demonstrates slow initial rise with delayed   persistent enhancement.  Biopsy clip artifact is noted along the   anterolateral margin of the non-mass enhancement (axial T1 non-FS image   46). LEFT Breast: No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features   of malignancy are identified. OTHER: Decrease in size of right level I and   II axillary adenopathy with biopsy clip artifact within a biopsy proven   nodal metastasis (axial T2 image 138). No left axillary adenopathy.

Given the above, in situations where the absolute eGFR value will directly affect clinical decision-making (e.g. medication dose or appropriateness), clinicians should consider using serum cystatin C to estimate GFR (which does not involve the   consideration of race), directly measure GFR and/or consult with nephrology.

Tumor is also   seen in the adjacent fat where it infiltrates in a fairly insidious   manner with the absence of significant stromal response. Tumor cells are   seen at multiple foci at the lateral margin and also focally at the   anterior margin. There is also a fair amount of tumor cells in the   additionally submitted new right breast lateral-anterior margin which   are also seen at the final margin in at least 2 foci (multifocal   involvement).

Ms. ***** was referred to us by  her primary care physician, Dr. ***** *****.    Ms. ***** was in her usual state ***** good health until February of this  year, when on her second routine screening mammogram on 04/06/2010 a  suspicious area was identified in the left breast and an immediate  biopsy was performed.  The results of that biopsy showed intermediate  grade ductal carcinoma in-situ with cribriform and micropapillary  patterns and focal necrosis with microcalcifications.  Subsequently, the  patient had a bilateral MRI exam of the breast which showed  new  calcifications in the left breast spanning approximately 2 cm which were  considered suspicious.    On 05/04/2010 Ms. ***** went and had a left breast biopsy which showed 3  cm of intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in-situ with comedo necrosis  and additional reexcision was performed on 05/27/2010 because of close  margins and the reexcision showed scar and biopsy site changes, some  fibrocystic changes, but no residual ductal carcinoma in-situ. The  pathology of her ductal carcinoma in-situ showed that the DCIS was both  estrogen and progesterone receptor positive.      At this time, Ms. ***** is doing well, recovering well from her  surgeries.  She has had a consultation with \n a medical oncologist and a  radiation oncologist and she comes here as a second opinion to discuss  what further therapy might be recommended for the treatment of her  recently diagnosed ductal carcinoma in-situ.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ms. *****'s past medical history is significant  for a history of gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease,  cholelithiasis with a cholecystectomy done several years ago.    MEDICATIONS ALLERGIES:  Amoxicillin, penicillin, ***** ***** and also  aspirin and over-the-counter pain killers.    GYNECOLOGIC HISTORY:  Menarche at 13; she is continuing to menstruate  regularly at this time.  She is currently on no birth control pills, but  had taken birth control pills for approximately 11 years, beginning at  the age of 30.  She is currently living with a significant other, has a  *****-***** job as an accountant.  She never drinks.  She does not use  ***** ***** and exercises regularly.    REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She is well -developed, well-nourished.  She has no  pain.  She has some fatigue and lack of energy, but denies significant  weight loss or change in appetite.  ENT:  Denies any ENT symptoms.  She  has normal vision, with no recent change in vision.  She has no  shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.  She denies palpitations or  chest pain.  She does complaining of feeling bloating, heartburn and  indigestion, but no other GI complaints.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  She denies  any musculoskeletal symptoms.  She denies any neurological symptoms and  she has no problems with her skin or hair.    FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother who had a sarcoma.  She had a  maternal grandmother who had breast cancer at 65 and had a paternal aunt  also with breast cancer at approximately the same age.  She has no other  family history of cancer.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  On physical exam, she is a well-developed, well-nourished  female in no acute distress.  HEENT:  NCAT.  \n PERRLA; EOMs are full.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.  LYMPH NODES:  There is no infraclavicular, supraclavicular or axillary  adenopathy bilaterally.  CHEST WALL EXAM:  Significant for symmetric breasts, with the left  breast having a inner quadrant scar covered by a Steri-Strips from her  most recent surgeries.  This area appears to be well healing at this  time.  There is some post surgical firmness underneath that scar, but no  other abnormal masses in the left breast.  The right breast is without  abnormal mass.  HEART:  The heart is normal rate and rhythm.  S1, S2 is within normal  limits.  ABDOMEN:  The abdomen is benign.  There is no organomegaly.  Bowel  sounds are present.  EXTREMITIES:  The extremities are without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  NEUROLOGIC:  Exam is grossly intact to motor and sensory exam.    ASSESSMENT:  Ms. ***** is a 41-year-old woman with a recently  diagnosed 3 cm ductal carcinoma in-situ with comedo necrosis which was  also felt to be intermediate grade; estrogen and progesterone receptors  were positive on the ductal carcinoma in-situ tissue.  Ms. ***** had  an additional surgery after her excision because of close margins and  there was no additional ductal carcinoma in-situ at this reexcision.    I had a long discussion with Ms. ***** about our approach to the  treatment of ductal carcinoma in-situ and its nature.  I emphasized to  Ms. ***** that ductal carcinoma in-situ, although called carcinoma,  was a benign process and confined to the breast ducts.  I explained to  her that we were concerned about being sure this process did not recur,  as it had a propensity to do, because when it does recur 50% of the time  it would recur as invasive disease which could potentially threaten a  woman's life.    I explained to *****. ***** that the main approaches for the treatment of  ductal carcinoma in-situ post surgery was either with radiation \n therapy  and/or ***** therapy with tamoxifen.  I discussed with her the  fact that radiation therapy was much more potent in its ability to  decrease recurrence of ductal carcinoma in-situ and that tamoxifen could  do the same, only was not nearly as potent as the radiation.    I discussed with her the fact that given her size of ductal carcinoma  in-situ, as well as the presence of comedo necrosis, that she had a  fairly high risk for recurrence without any further therapy.  I  estimated that risk to be about 30%.  I suggested to her that a course  of radiation therapy would decrease that risk of recurrence to  approximately 3-4%; Ms. ***** seemed to understand this well.    I went on to discuss the use of tamoxifen and suggested that in addition  to its ability to slightly decrease the risk of this current ductal  carcinoma in-situ, that it would decrease the risk of the development of  new primary invasive breast cancer by 50%.  She seemed to understand  this well.    Give Ms. *****'s history of two postmenopausal relatives with  unilateral breast cancer and her brother's diagnosis with synovial cell  cancer, it was recommended to *****. ***** that she undergo BRCA testing  and this, I believe has been performed, although I do not have the  results at the time of my consultation today.  Obviously, the results of  this would impact on any recommendations that might be made to limit Ms.  *****'s risk of developing an invasive breast cancer, but at this  time, for purposes of this second opinion, I will assume that this is  negative and could readdress the issue of prophylaxis of breast cancer  in a BRCA or other specific mutation positive patient at some later  date.    We went over some of the side effects of tamoxifen, including  postmenopausal symptomatology, although I did suggest that given her  young age she may not be rendered postmenopausal with tamoxifen therapy  immediately. We also discussed \n the increased clotting risk and the  potential for stroke and PE, in addition to the increased risk of  uterine cancer associated with tamoxifen use.  I suggested to *****.  ***** that although there was risk with tamoxifen, that the overall  risk benefit ratio was positive. I would strongly encourage a course of  radiation therapy to decrease the risk of recurrence of her ductal  carcinoma in-situ and a coarse of tamoxifen prophylaxis is also worth  consideration.  Ms. ***** understands all this well and will return to  her primary physicians for further discussion and definitive treatment.    *****,    ***** *****, *****., PH.*****.

There are scattered areas of fibroglandular tissue.    RIGHT Breast:  No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified.    LEFT Breast:  There is a heterogeneous 23 anteroposterior x 23 transverse x 24 craniocaudal mm (axial post contrast image 47/*****, sagittal reformat image 118/*****) oval mass with irregular margins and rim enhancement in the inner central left breast. ***** intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics.  Extending anterolateral from the index malignancy is non-mass enhancement with clumped internal enhancement, with a total extent of disease measuring 31 mm (axial post contrast image 52/***** of series 2).    IMPRESSION:   Left breast: Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6).  Right breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1).    July 06 bx:  FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS    Left breast, ultrasound-guided core biopsy:   1. At least ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade; see  comment.  2. Biopsy site changes and necrosis.  3. Microcalcifications with stroma and as detached fragments.       COMMENT:  The biopsy consists mostly of granulation tissue, foamy \n macrophages,  hemosiderin and fibrin, consistent with biopsy site changes. Also noted  are fragments of necrotic tissue. Relatively scant carcinoma is sampled,  most with smooth round contour while some partially disrupted by the  granulation tissue and foamy macrophages. To further characterize the  carcinoma, the following immunostains are performed and evaluated on  block A1:    - *****: Positive around some tumor nests; negative around other tumor  nests.  - SMM: Positive around some tumor nests; negative around other tumor  nests.  - *****/6: Positive around some tumor nests; negative around other tumor  nests. Negative in tumor cells.    Positive *****, SMM and *****/6 around some tumor nests supports the  presence of DCIS. Tumor nests with negative *****, SMM and *****/6 are  largely associated with and disrupted by granulation tissue, which may  impact the staining for myoepithelial markers. Overall, the findings are  not diagnostic of invasion in this limited biopsy. Patient's prior  biopsy (*****-*****) is reviewed concurrently. Given two biopsies with  findings not diagnostic of invasion, we would recommend complete  excision for definite evaluation of invasion.    Dr. ***** ***** has reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis.    Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors were  performed by manual morphometry on block A1.    The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is moderate to  strong nuclear staining in ~90% of tumor cells. Internal positive  control is present, and external positive control is appropriate.    The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is variable  (ranging from weak to strong) nuclear staining in ~60% of tumor cells.  Internal positive control is present, and external positive control is  appropriate.      Methodology  Fixative: 10% Neutral-buffered formalin  Cold ischemia time: < 1 hour  Duration of fixation: 6-72 hours   ER antibody \n clone: SP1 (*****)  PR antibody clone: 1E2 (*****)       Interpretive criteria  ER/PR:  Positive: reported when = 1% of invasive tumor cells shows any nuclear  staining  Negative: reported when < 1% of invasive cells shows any nuclear  staining.

Previous biopsy shows detached fragment of  carcinoma (*****-*****). The patient now undergoes re-sampling for  additional testing.      Gross Description  The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with patient's name,  medical record number and \"left breast mass,\" and consists of multiple  irregular cores and fragments of soft white-pink to dark red tissue (1.2  x 0.8 x 0.1 cm in aggregate). The specimen is entirely submitted in  cassette *****. (lds)    All controls performed with the immunohistochemical stains reported  above reacted appropriately.

HPI: The patient presented to the ***** ***** ***** on 09/10/16 with a painful lump in her left axilla which she thought had been exacerbated after several days of intense exercise including upper body weights.  She was provided with a prescription for dicloxacillin at the ED and told to follow up with her PCP, who then referred her for a mammogram and ultrasound.     A diagnostic mammogram on 09/29/16 was notable for extremely dense breast tissue and possibly a new, partially circumscribed, partially obscured nodule (1.2 cm) at the 2:00 position in the right breast.  A targeted right breast ultrasound at the 2:00 position was notable for a hypoechoic structure (1.4 cm) that corresponded to the mammographic nodule, likely a cyst with debris.  Targeted ultrasound of a palpable abnormality in the upper outer right breast was notable for multiple simple cysts (largest 3.8 cm).  A targeted left axillary ultrasound of the palpable mass demonstrated a solid, hypoechoic mass (1.6 x 1.3 x 1.4 cm).    She underwent an US-guided left axillary LN biopsy on 10/28/16 which demonstrated metastatic carcinoma of mammary origin, with the lymph node largely replaced.  Biomarkers were notable for ER+ (60%), PR+ (70%), *****- (IHC 2+; FISH ratio 1.4).  She underwent a right breast needle aspiration of the nodule at the 2:00 position which was consistent with a cyst with reactive/degenerative cellular changes and no malignancy.    ***** underwent a breast MRI on 11/09/16 which was notable for an area of irregular asymmetric non-mass enhancement (4 x 2.5 x 3 cm) in the upper left breast, posterior third at the \n 12:00 position, 7 cm from the nipple with extension posteriorly to the pectoralis muscle without muscle involvement.  In addition, in the upper inner left breast, middle third, there was a bilobed enhancing nodule (1 cm), located 5 cm from the nipple, and 3 cm from the chest wall.  A lymph node (2.5 cm) was present in the left axilla with associated clip as well as additional prominent asymmetric left axillary LN.  The right breast was notable for scattered cysts, but no suspicious enhancing masses.    She then underwent a left breast US to look at the MRI-findings at the 12:00 position demonstrated an area of hypoechogenicity (2.3 cm). A left breast US-guided core biopsy at the 12:00 position was notable for invasive ductal carcinoma with ER+ (100%), PR+ (100%), *****- (IHC 2+; FISH ratio 1.4).  A left breast US to look at the MRI-findings at the 10:00 position demonstrated a vague hypoechoic area.  A left breast US-guided core biopsy at the 10:00 position was notable for invasive ductal carcinoma, also with ER+ (100%), PR+ (100%), *****- (IHC 0).  This biopsy was sent for ***** and resulted as low risk with a score of 11.    She underwent a PET with CT for attenuation purposes on 11/22/16 demonstrated no uptake in known left axillary LN metastasis or in the left breast, however, uptake in the bone marrow of T7-L1 was slightly more prominent, of unclear significance.  A thoracic spine MRI on 12/07/16 was notable for no evidence of metastases.    She has met with Dr. ***** ***** in ***** ***** who recommended neoadjuvant dose-dense AC followed by paclitaxel as well as Dr. ***** at ***** ***** ***** who recommended proceeding with surgical resection first to assess extent of disease.  Today patient also met with Drs. ***** and ***** regarding L breast mastectomy and reconstruction and has scheduled her surgery for 01/06/17.

When this side effect occurs, it affects primarily the bowels, liver, skin, nerves and the endocrine system. This immune reaction can occur during treatment but can also be seen weeks or months after discontinuation of treatment. Symptoms of this reaction will be monitored throughout treatment (diarrhea, rash, and neuropathy). Lab work will check for elevated liver enzymes and thyroid function.    Contact your health care provider right away if you have any new or worsening symptoms.    Not all side effects are listed above. Some that are rare (occurring in less than 10% of patients) are not listed here. However, you should always inform your health care provider if you experience any unusual symptoms.    Gemzar (Gemcitabine)    Side Effects:  Important things to remember about Gemzar side effects:    Most people do not experience all of the Gemzar side effects listed.  Gemzar side effects are often predictable in terms of their onset, duration and severity.  Gemzar side effects are almost always reversible and will go away after treatment is complete.  There are many options to help minimize or prevent Gemzar side effects.  There is no relationship between the presence or severity of Gemzar side effects and the effectiveness of Gemzar.    The following Gemzar side effects are common (occurring in more than 30%) for patients taking Gemzar:    Flu-like symptoms (muscle pain, fever, headache, chills, fatigue)  Fever  (within 6-12 hours of first dose)  Fatigue  Nausea (mild)  Vomiting  Poor appetite  Skin rash  Low blood counts.  Your white and red blood cells and platelets may temporarily decrease.

However, you should always inform your health care provider if you experience any unusual symptoms.    Carboplatin (Paraplatin)    Carboplatin Side Effects:  Important things to remember about the side effects of Carboplatin:    Most people do not experience all of the side effects listed.  Side effects are often predictable in terms of their onset and duration.  Side effects are almost always reversible and will go away after treatment is complete.  There are many options to help minimize or prevent side effects.  There is no relationship between the presence or severity of side effects and the effectiveness of Carboplatin.  The side effects of Carboplatin and their severity depend on how much of Carboplatin is given.  In other words, high doses may produce more severe side effects).    The following side effects are common (occurring in greater than 30%) for patients taking Carboplatin:    Low blood counts (including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets)  *****: Meaning low point, nadir is the point in time between chemotherapy cycles in which you experience low blood counts.

Sensory loss, numbness and tingling, and difficulty in walking may last for at least as long as therapy is continued. These side effects may become progressively more severe with continued treatment, and your doctor may decide to decrease your dose.  Central neurotoxicity:  Infrequent but patients over age 65 are at increased risk.  Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, visual changes, ringing in the ears.  Nephrotoxicity (see kidney problems):  More frequent when Carboplatin is given in high doses or to people with kidney problems.  Hearing loss (ototoxicity) - loss of high pitched sounds.  Abnormal blood electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, calcium).   Abnormal blood liver enzymes (SGOT, Alkaline phosphatase) (see liver problems).  Cardiovascular events.  Although infrequent, heart failure, blood clots and strokes have been reported with Carboplatin use.  Less than 1% were life-threatening.   Allergic reaction may occur.  It would occur during the actual transfusion.  This may include itching, rash, shortness of breath or dizziness (especially in patients who have received cisplatin).

She is here to discuss systemic therapy options.     We had a lengthy discussion with the patient in which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. We reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. We discussed the use of \n locoregional therapies to reduce risk of locoregional disease and the use of systemic therapies to primarily reduce risk of systemic disease. Informed her that locoregional breast cancer is curable and that the goal would be to reduced her risk of developing systemic disease, which can potentially be incurable. Based on the currently available information, she seems to have a locoregional disease but needs to be confirmed with staging CT scans, which we have ordered today.    Because she has HR+ disease, she will need at least 5 years of hormonal therapy. Data from *****/TEXT trial demonstrated that patient who were premenopausal at their breast cancer diagnosis and recovered ovarian function after completion of chemotherapy, the combination of ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor was superior to tamoxifen in terms of preventing distant recurrence particularly in those under 35. Thus, would favor *****+*****, regardless of chemotherapy. We reviewed possible side effects from *****, including but not limited to urogenital atrophy, vasomotor symptoms, and musculoskeletal/joint stiffness or pain. We also reviewed the potential for acceleration of bone density loss associated with initiation of ovarian suppression plus an aromatase inhibitor. We also discussed the importance of exercise in helping to alleviate this symptoms.     We reviewed data from ***** trial which evaluated 5,015 patients with stage II/III breast cancer, March 30 involved nodes, and a RS ? 25. Patients were assigned to receive either endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy plus standard chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 5.1 years, there was a significant association between chemotherapy benefit and menopausal status (P = .004). The absolute benefit in this cohort was 5.2% at 5 years for disease free survival. Although it is a short follow up for HR+ disease, there was also a 1.3% absolute benefit in 5-year overall survival in the premenopausal \n cohort. The majority of premenopausal women received adjuvant *****, not *****+***** so we still do not know if the benefit was related to ovarian suppression effects of chemotherapy or chemotherapy itself. Similar findings were seen in ***** with a MP low risk (clinical high risk) cancer. Her MP was low risk. Given her age, we will order an ***** as well to provide us with more information on her tumor biology and likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy.

It is likely that she has additional LNs with metastatic disease. This is estimated to be about 64% by the MSKCC normogram and 44% by the ***** normogram. The role of axillary dissection and its pros/cons have been discussed with her by Dr. *****. ***** remains with a considerable risk of systemic relapse and mortality from this cancer. Although the most accurate risk assessment is not possible without quantitative LN data from an axillary dissection, her risk is clearly high. I estimate her risk to be on the order of 60% or higher. This can be reduced with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, *****-targeting therapy. hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, and bisphosphonate therapy. These modalities were discussed.    ***** will benefit from adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Recommendation was made for adjuvant AC/THP chemotherapy. This consists of AC x 4 given q2weeks with growth factor support, followed by 12 weeks of taxol along with one year of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Side effects were discussed including potential for nausea/vomiting, alopecia, bone marrow suppression and infections, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and a small risk of secondary leukemias. As an alternative, we also discussed the TCHP regimen. This consists of 6 cycles of TCHP with one year of trastuzumab/pertuzumab. Side effects are similar with sparing of the cardiomyopathy and leukemogenic risks.     We also discussed the use of extended adjuvant neratinib in year 2 including the potential for diarrhea and the need for prophylactic anti-*****.     ***** will also benefit from adjuvant hormone therapy. A recommendation was made for Arimidex 1 mg PO daily for a duration of 10 years. This would begin at the completion of chemotherapy. Side effects were discussed \n including the potential for ***** and myalgias, as well as acceleration of bone loss and associated complications including bone fractures. In the case of intolerable arthralgias or myalgias, treatment can be changed to other aromatase inhibitors or possibly to tamoxifen. Bone loss can be monitored by densitometry scanning and can be reduced or reversed with a number of bone strengthening agents available for this purpose. We also discussed the use of ***** infusions to maintain bone density as well as reduce the recurrence risk associated with breast cancer.    ***** requires adjuvant breast radiotherapy to complete her breast conservation management. Referral will be made to ***** at the completion of chemotherapy for a consultation and further management.    We discussed her family history and the low likelihood of an inherited susceptibility. I offered a referral to genetic counseling for further evaluation.     ***** has significant concerns about the toxicities associated with these therapies. She will be thinking about these options over the next few weeks. She also plans to return to *****, and if she is to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, she would want to get it on the island of ***** where she lives. She also has concerns about co-pays that may be associated with treatment and her ability to work, disability options, and other practical considerations.

She reports feeling better and being able to move more.    - She called in last week with concern because her incision macerated. She is continuing to have breast pain and soreness though it is improving.    - She started PT. She states that it was painful initially, but she does practice the exercises 3 x day. Her goal is to have pre-op range of motion. She has also increased her walking.    - Since starting letrozole, she notices more joint pain on feet (prior on knees only) mostly in the morning. In the beginning it was difficult to walk but she is adjusting.    - She also notes nausea in the afternoon that might have been caused by oxycodone. She is still taking oxycodone a day and her goal is to wean off it soon.     - She notes some hair thinning since starting treatment.    - She has numbness on her right foot toe pads (#***** ***** #*****). She has *****/needles on the rest of the right foot and left foot.    - She continues to have hot flashes, but adjusts to it by varying how much clothes she wears at night.

I again discussed with ***** the natural history and treatment of oligometastatic breast cancer in a premenopausal patient.  We discussed again the results from her surgery.  She is aware that in general metastatic breast cancer is not curable, but treatable, with primary goals of prolongation of life, while maintaining a good quality of life without excessive toxicities.  I noted that systemic medications are the mainstay of treatment for MBC, but that in select cases of oligometastatic disease we consider using local therapies such as surgery and radiation as has been done in her case.    She will continue with ovarian suppression as well as an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole).  We will start palbociclib when she completes radiation and has recovered from the SE.   \n   Oligometastatic *****+/*****- IDC of left breast and T6  - continue leuprolide every 4 weeks  - continue letrozole  - referred to radiation oncology  - repeat PET/CT in ~3-4 months after radiation  - start palbociclib after radiation     ***** flashes  - will start acupuncture     Bone Health - Was started on zoledronic acid in c/o T6 lesion - will get every 3 months.  - DEXA scan (re-ordered)  - calcium 1250 mg daily (in diet or supplemental form)  - vitamin D 1000 to 2000 units daily  - weight bearing exercise    The patient will return to clinic in 4 weeks.

She has completed the surgical management of her early stage breast cancer. I estimate that without adjuvant \n therapy, her risk of future relapse and mortality from this cancer is on the order of 10%. This can be reduced with the use of adjuvant hormone therapy. A recommendation was made for Arimidex 1 mg PO daily for a duration of 5 years. Side effects were discussed including the potential for ***** and myalgias, as well as acceleration of bone loss and associated complications including bone fractures. In the case of intolerable arthralgias or myalgias, treatment can be changed to other aromatase inhibitors or possibly to tamoxifen. Bone loss can be monitored by densitometry scanning and can be reduced or reversed with a number of bone strengthening agents available for this purpose. We also discussed the data for ***** showing reduction in breast cancer recurrence in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer. We only briefly discussed the role of chemotherapy in the management of breast cancer, as the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are quite small or negligible for her disease biology and risk level.     ***** is not sure she wants to take hormone therapy. This is mainly due to negative things she has heard about them from friends and research. She will think about it and get back to us. If she ***** to take hormone therapy, I will place the prescription, and we will schedule a 6 month follow-up for her.      \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

Stage I triple negative breast cancer on the left side *****, ***** of 90%.   2.  I would recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy with dose dense AC followed by weekly taxol.  She will need a port placed.  This allows her to get rapid systemic treatment and we can assess her sensitivity to chemotherapy.   3.  It also would be fine for her to have surgery first if by MRI she has truly a stage I cancer.  The rapidity with which this can happen is crucial.  She needs to start chemotherapy no later than one month from diagnosis.   4.  MRI of bilateral breasts.   5.  Genetics consult.  Her mother had breast cancer and her May 20 sister had breast cancer in her 30s.   6.  I encouraged her to find a local oncologist for her to work with asap.   7.  We discussed the role of radiation to decrease the risk of local recurrence.  Depending on her pathology she may not need radiation if she has a mastectomy.   8.  We discussed the role of chemotherapy to decrease the risk of systemic recurrence.         ***** ***** *****, MD  Medical Oncology/Hematology    TIME SPENT: 60 minutes time on ***** patient, reviewing chart, coordinating care, discussing with patient and/or family.    \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

She underwent a lumpectomy and ***** and completed 3 cycles of TC followed by one cycle of Abraxane and Cytoxan. She completed XRT and started tamoxifen on 05/27/17.    1. Right Breast cancer: ***** is currently without evidence of recurrence either locally or systemically based on physical exam findings or review of symptoms. She has been seen in the Survivorship clinic  and was advised to stop Tamoxifen and switch to letrozole. However, there was no symptom improvement on letrozole so she was recently advised to switch to Exemestane. She was not aware of this recommendation. I again recommended discontinuing Letrozole and waiting 2-3 weeks before starting Exemestane to see if she tolerates it better. She understands that we still recommend at least 5 years of hormonal therapy and \n despite her side effects, she does have intentions of continuing hormone therapy for 5 years.    She is due for her right mammogram in July. Continue mammograms alternating with MRI  and every 6 month clinical breast exam.    2. Depression: She is currently on Pristiq 75 mg. I discussed with her the value of Duloxetine for ***** induced joint pain but I am concerned about the drug interaction of these two medications. I will refer her to psychiatry to determine how to best proceed with a transition from ***** to duloxetine. I discussed with her the most common side effects of Duloxetine including fatigue, nausea, headache, and dry mouth.     3. Weight: Her weight has been stable since November/December 2017.     ***** with me in 6 months.     I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 25 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, medication risks, lifestyle modification, symptoms and therapeutic options.

Standard fixation in ***** ***** is 6-72 hours for all  samples. Fixation time is unknown for samples processed in other  laboratories.  A histologic section from the selected tumor block was  reviewed by a pathologist to evaluate tumor and normal tissue  morphology, and an adjacent paraffin section was used for FISH analysis.   That section was ***** with fluorescent probes from the *****  ***** (TM) ***** DNA Probe *****, which includes probes for centromere  17 (*****) and *****.  The tumor slide was denatured and subsequently  allowed to hybridize with the ***** (TM) probes.

Enumeration of ***** and ***** signals was conducted by manual  microscopic examination of cell nuclei using a fluorescence microscope  equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filters.  A control  slide with both tumor showing ***** amplification and tissue without  amplification demonstrated the appropriate signal patterns.     Educational Note:  According to CAP/***** guidelines, fixed specimens should be fixed in 10%  neutral-buffered formalin for 6-72 hours; specimens fixed in other  solutions or for durations outside this range may perform differently in  this assay.

Breast MRI from 09/02/19 showed a dramatic response to therapy and near total complete resolution of the mass and enhancement in the left breast.     She underwent a left partial mastectomy and ***** on \n 09/19/19 which unfortunately still contained 3.8 x 3.5 cm grade 2 IDC that was ER+/PR-/***** (2+) by IHC, negative by FISH.

There were isolated tumor cells in the third LN.  Intermediate-high grade focal DCIS was also present. Since the margins were positive after the lumpectomy, she underwent re-excision on 10/16/19 and no additional cancer was found. She started letrozole on 10/04/19.    She states that the local radiation oncologist recommended additional lymph node dissection, but ***** local surgeon ***** so she sought a second rad onc opinion with Dr. ***** *****. She proceeded with radiation to her left breast and axilla instead of additional surgery. She started XRT to the whole left breast and regional nodes on 11/26/19 at *****.     She reports discoloration and peeling on the skin after XRT. She thinks that she tolerated it well. She has not met with physical therapy.    She had a ***** IUD so she did not have regular menses for a number of years. The ***** was removed in March 2019. Upon questioning, she states that she did not experience hot flashes or other menopausal symptoms before her cancer diagnosis. However, she developed hot flashes during chemotherapy. She states that chemotherapy also affected her sleep.     She reports arthralgias with letrozole. She is not exercising as much as she used to.

There are no suspicious microcalcifications. Density:   Category C : The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses.      ULTRASOUND:    TECHNIQUE: Multiple sonographic images were obtained of the left breast and also of the left   axilla.    FINDINGS: There is a poorly defined mass with prominent vascularity and associated shadowing in   the left breast at about 3:30, 3.2 cm from the nipple. This corresponds to the palpable   abnormality. The mass measures approximately 2.8 x 3.3 x 3.9 cm, although margins are not   well-defined.    In the left axilla there are multiple lymph nodes. These measure 1.4 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm, 1.2 x 2.0   x 2.0 cm, 1.5 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm, 0.9 x 1.9 x 2.5 cm and 0.6 x 0.7 x 1.3 cm. At least one of these   demonstrates abnormal morphology.

TECHNIQUE: After \n fasting and a suitable delay of 60 minutes following the intravenous   administration of 15.63 mCi 18F-FDG at the right hand, 3D body imaging is performed from the   base of the skull to below the pelvis using the General Electric Discovery ST PET/CT scanner.   Initially, a low dose CT is performed for attenuation correction and anatomic correlation.   Subsequent 3.0 minute bed positions were then performed for acquisition of the PET data set   with subsequent fusion with the CT for the diagnostic data set. The patient's blood glucose at   the time of injection was 88 mg/dL.    RADIATION DOSIMETRY: CTDIvol: 5.6 mGy   Total exam DLP: 497.85 mGy-cm    COMPARISON: Pelvic ultrasound from 10/23/2008.    FINDINGS: The distribution of 18F-FDG in the visualized brain, myocardium and the urinary tract   appears physiologic.     Head and neck: There is no hypermetabolic deep cervical lymphadenopathy.     Thorax: There is a hypermetabolic mass in the outer quadrant of the left breast with associated   clip. The mass is isodense to the adjacent glandular tissue, measuring approximately 2.2 x 1.8   cm with maximum SUV 3.4. Additional note is made of 2 enlarged hypermetabolic left axillary   lymph node. The larger and more hypermetabolic lymph node measures 10 mm in short axis   dimension with maximum SUV 4.2. No enlarged right metabolic internal mammary lymph nodes are   identified.    No hypermetabolic hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is present.     There are no pulmonary nodules or pleural effusions.     The heart size appears normal. There is a trace pericardial effusion.    Abdomen and pelvis: There are no hypermetabolic lesions in the liver, adrenal glands or   retroperitoneal lymph nodes. There is a small non-FDG avid low-density lesion in hepatic *****,   likely a cyst, measuring 7 mm.    The uterus is prominent in size. There is focal linear uptake within the right side of the   uterus with maximum SUV 4.5. A \n corresponding abnormality is difficult to visualize on the   noncontrast images.    Musculoskeletal: Spondylotic changes are present within the spinal axis. There are no   hypermetabolic or osteolytic bone metastases.    IMPRESSION:   1. Hypermetabolic mass in the outer quadrant of the left breast, consistent with known breast   cancer.  2. Hypermetabolic left axillary lymph nodes, consistent with nodal metastatic disease.  3. Somewhat linear abnormal uptake eccentric lesion within the right side of the uterus. A   corresponding abnormality difficult to determine on the noncontrast images. This could relate   to uptake within the endometrial canal that is displaced, which can be seen physiologically in   patients of reproductive age. Alternately, this could represent uptake in the endometrial canal   due to inflammatory change in this patient status post recent IUD removal. However, the   eccentric nature of the uptake is atypical for endometrial uptake. Recommend a pelvic   ultrasound for initial further evaluation to ensure that this does not correspond with a   uterine mass.      05/31/19: Brain MRI:      Technique:     Diffusion axial  Axial T2 FLAIR  Axial T2 fast spin-echo  Sagittal T1 FLAIR  Gradient echo axial  T1-weighted axial    Contrast enhanced sequences: None  Contrast dose: 6 ml IV Gadavist.

Metastatic ductal carcinoma,  measuring 15 mm in extent, is present in one of the submitted left  axillary sentinel lymph nodes in part D. Micrometastatic tumor is  present in one of two lymph nodes in part E. An immunoperoxidase stain  for cytokeratin (*****/AE3) highlights isolated tumor cells in both  submitted nodes in part E, as well as extranodal tumor cells  infiltrating adipose tissue. An immunostain for cytokeratin (*****/AE3) is  negative for micrometastatic tumor and isolated tumor cells in the  submitted lymph node in part F. No lymph nodes are present in the  submitted left axillary tissue in part G. The ill-defined tumor in part  A represents an invasive carcinoma demonstrating grade II  histopathologic features. Complimentary immunoperoxidase stains for  E-Cadherin and ***** catenin \n establish ductal differentiation. Focal  intermediate to high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (D/CIS), solid  pattern is also noted. The invasive tumor is located mid lateral and  extends to the lateral margin, measuring 38 x 35 mm. The superior and  deep margins are also involved by invasive tumor in part A. Invasive  ductal carcinoma is present in part B (submitted as lateral margin),  extending from the medial edge (corresponding to the lateral margin in  part A). The invasive carcinoma measures 8.0 x 6.0 mm. The new lateral  margin in part B is not involved by tumor (>1.0 cm).

It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and  Drug Administration, although such approval is not required for  analyte-specific reagents of this type.    Assessment and Plan:  ***** ***** is a 49 y.o. female with locally advanced ER+/PR-/***** negative left breast cancer. She received DD-AC from *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****. She started Paclitaxel on 06/10/19, but it was discontinued on 06/24/19 due to elevated transaminases. She then received weekly Abraxane from 07/05/19 to 08/30/19. She underwent left partial mastectomy and ***** on 09/19/19 and re-excision on 10/16/19. She started letrozole on 10/04/19 and received XRT to the left breast and regional nodes on 11/26/19.    1. Breast Cancer: I had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her husband in which I reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. We discussed *****'s neoadjuvant chemotherapy and treatment effect.    Her overall response to chemo was disappointing since it appeared that she had responded much better on imaging. However, I reassured ***** that there are still treatments to reduce recurrence risk. Since the cancer was ER+, we discussed hormonal therapy and I explained the difference between SERM and *****. Since she is high risk, I would favor an ***** (along with OS or oophorectomy if she recovers ovarian function).  I recommended testing for estradiol \n and FSH once every 1-2 months until September 2020 at least. I stressed that it is important that she is confirmed to remain  post-menopausal while on letrozole. We discussed that if she is not post-menopausal, we can administer ovarian suppression shots or she can have an oophorectomy performed. I also recommend a baseline DEXA scan to see if there is a need for a bisphosphonate. I explained that a hysterectomy is not necessary.    Additionally, we discussed ***** and the results of the ***** study. I explained the recent press releases for both palbociclib (***** study) and publication of data on abemaciclib (*****) in the adjuvant setting. I explained that while palbociclib did not show an improvement in ***** at a median FUP of about 3 years in the ***** trial, ***** did show benefit in the ***** study. We also briefly discussed the ***** study. I reviewed the side effects of ***** including diarrhea. I explained that if the medication is too hard to tolerate at 300 mg a day, she can discuss dose reduction with her oncologist.     I also explained ***** guidelines regarding imaging and tumour markers. We discussed Levulan PDT and vitamins/supplements and I do not think there would be any interaction with abemaciclib      I encouraged the patient to sign up for and utilize Mychart since this is the best way to communicate new information to me and to help determine whether a follow up visit is warranted    I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 60 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 50 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding Treatment options, side effects, clinical trials, and follow up plan . Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.    *****, ***** ***** ***** am acting as a scribe for services provided by ***** ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM     The above \n scribed documentation accurately reflects the services I have provided.    ***** ***** *****, MD   *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM        \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

History of Present Illness:     28 year old female who felt a left breast mass.  She sought medical attention and was diagnosed January 2021 with a large left IDC, HR positive and her 2 neu negative.  On MRI the tumor is 10.3 x 4.5 x 3.5 cm.  The axillary biopsy was positive.  She had staging studies which show a suspicious lesion in the sternum.  She is to have a biopsy of this area.  She was started on dd AC and is tolerating okay.  She is here for a second opinion.  She is asking to transfer her care to me but I stressed that it is very important for her to stay on schedule with her chemotherapy with her current oncologist.      We discussed the difference between widely metastatic disease and oligo metastatic disease.  I would treat her aggressively because she has a good long term chance of control with a single bone site involved which can be radiated and the HR+ her 2 negative phenotype.      I would add xgeva if biopsy is positive.  The biopsy of the bone is planned.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Patient Active Problem List    Diagnosis Date Noted   \u0007 Breast cancer (CMS code) 07/05/2020     10/18/19: Bilateral screening \n mammogram: There is developing asymmetry within the central right breast best. No suspicious masses, *****, or unexplained architectural distortion of the left breast. Incomplete- need additional imaging. ***** 0.  11/11/19: Diagnostic mammogram: Spot compression 3D/tomosynthesis views of the right breast demonstrate a less conspicuous focal asymmetry in the 12:00 o'clock position of the right breast, posterior depth. It does not appear to have discrete margins as one would expect for a mass. Appears most consistent with fibroglandular tissue.  11/11/19: Right breast ultrasound: Targeted US of the right breast fails to confirm any suspicious mass in the area of screening mammographic concern. No axillary lymphadenopathy.     Right breast IDC  05/29/20: Right diagnostic mammo: When compared to prior mammo in 11/11/19 there has been interval development of a suspicious group of pleomorphic calcifications within the 12:00 subareolar position. This is the site of the palpable lump. There is a newly apparent mass at this level that measures approx. 2cm. The anterior margin of the mass appears to be within 1cm of the nipple  05/29/20: Right breast ultrasound: A clinically palpable lump is noted at the 12:00 subareolar position. Targeted sonography reveals an irregular mass measuring 2.3 x 1.4 x 1cm from the nipple. It demonstrates multiple internal hyperechoic structures c/w calcifications on mammography. The anterior inferior margin is within 1cm of the nipple. There is also an irregular hypoechoic mass at the 1:00 o'clock position 5cm from the nipple. It measures 1.0 x 0.9cm. At the 2:30 o'clock positon in the subareolar region there is a hypoechoic mass that measures 0.7x0.5cm.

Reports from ***** ***** ***** are available in ***** ***** and scanned clinical documents.      ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  ***** ***** is a 48 y.o. female with a recent diagnosis of right breast IDC which is ER weak positive (2%), PR low positive (7%), ***** neg (IHC 2+, FISH 2.March 09.8=1.4) and ***** 36% with ***** and axillary LN involvement here in consultation with medical oncology to discuss neoadjuvant chemotherapy.      First, we reviewed her pathology and imaging results. She has weakly ER and PR positive, ***** negative disease. She has locally advanced disease with *****-proven LN involvement, but no evidence of distant metastatic disease on PET/CT.     For local control, she will need lumpectomy or mastectomy - we defer to our surgical colleagues about which is the best option for her. She will likely also need post-operative radiation.     We explained that for systemic treatment, we would recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery given that she has ER and PR low positive disease with LN involvement. We discussed the advantages of offering chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in order to assess response to treatment, and to increase the chances of breast conserving surgery. Outside the context of a clinical trial, we would recommend AC/T. We typically give the taxol first, followed by four cycles of TC. We then explained the option of clinical trial enrollment with the ISPY clinical trial. We explained that some of these arms involve getting taxol with an experimental therapy. We discussed the role of the ***** result as a screening for the ISPY 2 clinical trial. We explained that in the context of this clinical trial, patients receive paclitaxel and or an experimental regimen first, and then proceed with the Adriamycin and Cytoxan. At present, HER-2/neu negative patients are randomized to receive one of the \n following regimens:  1. Control arm: Taxol weekly for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   2. Taxol weekly + pembrolizumab (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) every 3 weeks for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   3. ***** every 3 weeks for x 12 weeks (not with taxol), followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   4. Taxol weekly with oral olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) and durvalumab (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   5. Taxol weekly for *****-***** (a *****-9 agonist) with weekly Taxol and every 3 week Pembrolizumab for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   6. Taxol weekly with ***** (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) every 3 weeks for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   7.Taxol weekly with ***** (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) every 3 weeks and ***** 3767 (***** antibody) for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   8. ***** 985 (trastuzumab *****) - ***** ***** targeting antibody-drug conjugate for ***** low, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles    9. Oral paclitaxel plus ***** (an oral PGP inhibitor) plus ***** (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) with or without carboplatin followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles.     In order to participate in the trial, patients must undergo a baseline core biopsy for research purposes and a baseline protocol specific MRI. During the trial, patients will undergo one additional core biopsy of the breast mass in order to assess the biological changes that have occurred in the cancer in response to the ***** therapy plus chemotherapy. Patients will also undergo additional MRIs during the course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to assist in assessing response to treatment. We discussed the very ***** trial design and explained that if the patient is randomized to the non-paclitaxel \n containing arm (such as ***** or *****), they can switch back to paclitaxel if not responding or receive it post operatively. In any of the arms, if the patient appears to have progression of her tumor either by physical exam or breast imaging, there is the option of discontinuing the study treatment and either moving on to the AC or switching to paclitaxel.     We reviewed the anticipated side effects and toxicities of chemotherapy including increased risk of infection, hair loss, fatigue, and possibility of ovarian failure. We explained that anthracyclines are associated with a small chance of causing permanent damage to the heart (estimated to be about 1% with 4 cycles of adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) and that ***** are associated with development of neuropathy which is most often transient and rarely permanent.    We also mentioned that given she was ER/PR low positive, we would still recommend 5-10 years of endocrine therapy after surgery. We did not discuss the options in length today, but can do so at a later date.    She asked about whether she could continue to work as an ICU nurse during chemo. We advised her that many patients choose to work during weekly taxol, but it will largely depend on which arm she is randomized to, as some of the experimental arms are likely to be associated with more toxicity. Most patients choose to take off time during AC and then after recovering from chemotherapy.     Plan:  -- ***** order TTE  -- Port placement  -- Chemotherapy teaching session  -- She is interested in screening for ISPY; then will need research core biopsy, research breast MRI, labs. F/u pending *****.   -- F/u results of genetic testing (done locally last Mon)  -- After surgery, she will be considered for post operative radiation and we will recommend 5-10yrs of adjuvant endocrine therapy     RTC in 1-2 weeks in person to start chemo    Patient seen and discussed with breast oncology attending \n Dr. ***** *****.     ***** *****, MD PGY-5  Hematology/Oncology Fellow    \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

Juxtaposed relative to this at the inferior margin is a   lobular soft tissue mass spanning about 2.6 x 2.6 cm (series 2 image 114). This latter mass is more lobular in its margins than the mostly ovoid first mass just discussed. A right upper lobe anterior pulmonary nodule, for 4 x 4 mm, is observed (series 3   image 63). A left lower lobe posterolateral subpleural nodule is 4 x 3 mm (series 3 image 124). Another right upper lobe smaller nodule is equivocal, 3 x 2 mm against branching vessel (series 3 image 81). The left breast has coarse punctate   calcifications without a discernible mass otherwise. Bilateral axilla lymph nodes are present, without asymmetric enlargement on either side and with fatty *****, short axis ***** no greater than about 11 mm. The right thyroid lobe has a 4 mm   noncalcified sharply marginated hypoattenuating nodule (series 2 image 14). No evidence of intrathoracic or other lymphadenopathy. No other suspicious lung nodules/masses, pleural/pericardial fluid, defects in ***** ***** opacification, or   abnormalities otherwise of thyroid, other thoracic inlet aspects, other chest wall aspects or mediastinum.     Abdomen/pelvis: No evidence of malignancy identified in abdomen/pelvis.

R1, biopsy-proven malignant 3.8 cm mass with associated biopsy marker in the right breast 7:00, 4 cm from the nipple, with adjacent ***** enhancement extending along the lateral and anterior aspect of the mass, extending to the skin with associated   skin enhancement, likely combination of additional tumor involvement and postbiopsy changes. In total the abnormal enhancement spans 6 x 3.3 x 2.8 cm (AP by ***** by cc). Recommend continued surgical/oncologic management.     R2, biopsy-proven malignant 1.4 cm mass, 6:00, 8 cm from the nipple, with associated biopsy marker. The mass at least abuts the skin on MRI and on ultrasound is seen to partially extend into the skin. Recommend continued surgical/oncologic management.     No MRI correlate for the sonographic ***** altered echotexture at 6:00, 5 cm from the nipple. If it would impact clinical management, may consider ultrasound-guided biopsy of *****, note on ultrasound, ***** is between the biopsy-proven R1 and R2 malignant   masses.     A 2.2 cm area of skin thickening and enhancement the right breast 9 to 10:00 position, 6 cm from the nipple, indeterminate, recommend correlation with physical exam and histologic sampling as clinically warranted. This is separate from the R1 mass and is   not along the expected biopsy trajectory.     2 prominent low right axillary level one lymph nodes with possible cortical thickening, \n indeterminate, recommend further evaluation with MRI directed ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided biopsy.       2. Left Breast - BI-RADS 1 - NEGATIVE. No suspicious enhancement, within limitation of the marked background parenchymal enhancement.     RECOMMEND:   Recommend continued surgical/oncologic management of R1 and R2 biopsy-proven malignant masses.     Recommend MRI directed ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided biopsy of the right axilla for evaluation of the 2 prominent low right axillary lymph nodes.

Breast, right 6:00 N+8, core biopsy:     --  Poorly differentiated high-grade carcinoma with squamous   differentiation (0.35cm) (provisional ***** grade III, score:   3+3+3) (See comment)   Comment: Histologic sections of both biopsies (A and B) show involvement   by a high-grade carcinoma arranged in nests and cohesive sheets,   characterized by pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei with dense   eosinophilic cytoplasm. The neoplastic cells on both blocks A1 and B1   are strongly and diffusely positive for *****, supporting squamous   differentiation. They are also positive for GATA3 and ER (1+, 5-10%) and   negative for PR (0, 0%) and Her-2 (0). Although the positive expression   for GATA3 supports a breast primary, GATA3 staining is overall a   non-specific marker, and metastasis from ***** ***** namely the bladder   and the gynecologic tract need to also be considered. While the findings   are overall \n compatible with a breast primary (i.e. metaplastic   carcinoma), clinical and radiologic correlation is needed to exclude a   metastasis.

You  already know her history, but we will summarize it here for our  records.    IDENTIFICATION:  54-year-old ***** woman with ER-negative,  *****-*****, *****-2-negative breast cancer of the left side.    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ***** ***** is a 54-year-old ***** woman  who has a history of diabetes, MRSA infection, neuropathy and  hypertension, who has been doing routine mammogram screens.  Her last  normal mammogram was in February 2010.  In February 2011, during her shower,  she noticed there was a swollen lump under her left axilla.  In the  meantime, she also noticed her left breast was more swollen, enlarged,  edematous, and was painful as well.    The patient was seen by her primary care physician.  Antibiotic, Keflex,  was prescribed.  The patient was also instructed to follow back in two  weeks.  Per patient, the swelling and pain of her left breast did not  improve after one week of antibiotic.  The \n patient then called back her  primary care physician who referred her to Dr. *****, surgeon, for a  breast biopsy.    The patient had a diagnostic mammogram on 02/25/2011, which showed a  3-cm upper inner quadrant mass with diffuse skin thickening and left  axillary lymph node enlargement.  The patient underwent left breast  excisional biopsy on 02/25/2011.  This biopsy revealed grade 3  invasive ductal carcinoma, at least 2.5 cm, with ***** margins,  without lymphovascular invasion, *****-*****, *****-negative,  HER-2-negative.   *****-67 was at 59%.   ***** and eGFR were both positive.  In addition, skin shows a single-cell pagetoid change.  Given the large  size of the primary breast cancer, the patient was referred to *****.  *****, medical oncologist in *****.  She was planned for dose-dense  Adriamycin plus Cytoxan followed by dose-dense Taxol.  Her first cycle  of dose-dense Adriamycin plus Cytoxan was started on 04/03/2011.  At  that time she was given Adriamycin 600 mg/m2 for a total of 1320 mg (at  BSA 2.2) plus Cytoxan with ***** ***** ***** mg.  In addition, after her  chemotherapy the patient was given Neupogen at 480 mcg for a total of  three doses.  She tolerated her first chemotherapy well.  Her second  chemotherapy was on 04/22/2011.  At this time she was changed to  ***** 6 mg x1 injection postchemotherapy.    Per patient, two days after she completed her second cycle of dose-dense  Adriamycin plus Cytoxan, she started experiencing shortness of breath.  Also she developed abscesses in her buttock for which she sought medical  care with her primary care physician on 04/24/2011.   During her  clinical visit, in addition to the abscess, her primary care physician  also noticed she was more dyspneic.  The patient was sent to the  emergency room to have further workup.  A chest x-ray shows right-sided  middle lobe pneumonia.  In the meantime, she was also found to be  pancytopenia with WBC 0.9, ANC \n 0.5, hemoglobin 6.3, hematocrit 18.5,  platelet count 58K.  Per patient, she was given 4 units of blood  transfusion and antibiotics with vancomycin  and levaquin were started  as she had a history of an MRSA infection and she had an active  abscess.    On 04/29/2011 the patient developed severe dyspnea.  CT angio was  obtained to rule out pulmonary emboli, and she was negative for  pulmonary emboli; however, the CT scan did reveal that she had worsening  pleural effusion, especially on the right side.  She underwent a  pleurocentesis. Only a small amount of fluid was withdrawn to rule out  malignancy involvement.  Per patient, this test was negative for cancer  cell; however, we do not have the official report.  For her pleural  effusion she was treated with Lasix with good improvement.    On 04/30/2011 the patient underwent incision and drainage of her  right buttock abscess.  A total of two incisions were performed, and her  cultures did show that she had MRSA infection.    Per patient, during her hospitalization she was informed that given her  severe side effects secondary to chemotherapy, she is not a candidate  for further chemotherapy treatment.  The patient was also told that  given her poor nutrition and her profound pancytopenia, she is not a  candidate to undergo breast cancer surgical resection.  The patient was  referred to ***** by her medical oncologist, Dr. *****, for a second  opinion and for further management.    She is here today, accompanied by her brother.  Her symptoms have  resolved.  She denies any dyspnea.  She only had a mild buttock pain.  She is currently at her baseline energy level.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.

HER-2 was negative.  *****-67 was high at 59%.  ***** was positive.  EGFR  positive.    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ***** ***** is a 54-year-old postmenopausal  ***** woman who has a newly diagnosed left-sided breast cancer.    1.  Clinical stage II-III left-sided triple negative breast cancer.  The      patient had a recent diagnosis of left-sided breast cancer.  Her      cancer is associated with several high-risk factors including triple      negative, is relatively large in size with possible lymph node      involvement.  Fortunately, she does have a chemo-sensitive breast      cancer.  She only underwent two cycles of dose-dense Adriamycin plus      Cytoxan and she noticed a decrease in size of her left axillary      lymph node, likely from 8 cm to right now 2-3 cm.  In addition, her      left breast mass also decreased in size with less swelling.  Her      last chemotherapy was 04/19/2011, which was more than one month      ago.  She has not noticed any growing of her breast cancer, either      in her left breast or in her left axilla, suggesting patient does      have relative chemo-sensitive breast cancer.  However, her multiple      medical conditions would put her at high risk for chemotherapy,      which will need to be further improved before her next cycle of      treatment.             The patient has not well-controlled diabetes.  Her blood sugar      in general was around 200, and when she was on chemotherapy her      blood sugar was more than 400 mg/dL.  This not well-controlled      diabetes would make \n the patient prone to severe infection, which she      did develop after two cycles of Adriamycin plus Cytoxan with an      MRSA-positive abscess on her buttock.  In order for her to receive      further chemotherapy, it would be important for her to have relative      good control of her blood sugar.  We recommend the patient to      immediately contact her diabetes physician to have her blood sugar      well controlled.             Cardiac function.  The patient did develop a pleural effusion.      We reviewed Dr. *****'s notes during her hospitalization.  The      patient does not have a systolic dysfunction; however, she might      have a diastolic dysfunction.  She had an echocardiogram and an      adenosine stress test recently and we would like to obtain those      records to further evaluate her cardiac function post *****      treatment.  The likelihood of her developing cardiotoxicity from two      doses of Adriamycin is relatively low; however, there are patients      who are very sensitive to Adriamycin who might develop immediate      acute cardiac toxicity.             Abscess.  Her abscess has improved since the incision and      drainage and she completed her antibiotic treatment.  However, per      our exam she still has clear drainage from her abscess.  We suggest      patient to follow up with her surgeon.  Packing may speed up the      healing process, which will help patient to be ready for      chemotherapy soon.        Plans:        # We would like to obtain whole-body staging such as PET/CT scan      to rule out any distant metastases.        # We would like to obtain a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound to      evaluate her left breast cancer in order to obtain a baseline for      further comparison.        #  Regarding her chemotherapy regimen, we agree at this time that      she is not a candidate for further Adriamycin and Cytoxan.  However,      she does have a very chemo-sensitive \n triple negative breast cancer      and we would like to give her the best chemotherapy regimen possible      to cure this disease.   We recommend starting Abraxane now at a      weekly dose for a total of 12 weeks which can replace the weekly      Taxol in this regimen.  Abraxane can be given at 100 mg/m2 weekly  for a total of 12 weeks, which will give us three months' time to better  manage her diabetes and hopefully at that time the wound will further  heal.  If at that time her general health condition improves, we would  like to give her an additional two cycles of dose-dense Adriamycin plus  Cytoxan.  In general, we support this chemotherapy with *****  injection to prevent neutropenia or neutropenic fever.  To further  decrease her risk for an infection, we would also recommend starting her  on Levaquin post dose-dense AC cycle to prevent infection.           # We will also obtain her pathology specimens we reviewed here at      UCSF and to repeat her ER/PR and HER-2 status and confirm that she      has a negative status.        # Genetic counseling.  The patient developed triple negative      breast cancer at the age of 53, and without family history we would      like patient to meet with our genetic counselor to consider whether      genetic tests would be needed to rule out mutation.      We plan to start her chemotherapy on 06/05/2011 with prior      laboratory tests to evaluate her CBC, renal function, and liver      function.      Thank you very much for referring this lovely patient to our care.    ***** *****. *****, M.D.  CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE  UCSF COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER  ***** ***** ***** BREAST CARE CENTER    I have seen and examined the patient.

We discussed the benefits and ***** a bilateral mastectomy with is both very recommendable from disease extent as well as a mutation status of her ***** mutation .    If she chose to have a lumpectomy  she should have radiation,   Post mastectomy radiation would be considered if extensive disease is left and lymph nodes are involved.     There is no clear indication on ***** with a ***** mutation.  However her sons should be tested for the risk of ***** anemia in children (if the spouse also carriers a mutation and the risk for pancreatic cancer, which is probably not elevated until about age 50.     Return to clinical as needed for further consultation and with her sons.              IMPRESSION/PLAN:    Pain and distress: we discussed the level of distress and pain that the diagnosis brings to the patient.no new intervention is necessary.

We reviewed her 10/07/15 MRI b/l breasts with breast radiology, showing R breast mass (bx-proven) with October 14 abnormally enlarged level I R ***** *****.  Also benign appearing fibroglandular tissue in L axilla.    ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  52 F here for new diagnosis of minimum clinical stage IIB, T2 N1 Mx, *****+ *****- invasive lobular carcinoma R breast \n which is  with biopsy-proven axillary LN involvement.    We should begin by completing her staging with a PET/CT to be ordered today.  Assuming there are no distant mets, her cancer has a less aggressive biology (HR+ and *****, low *****) but with concern for high burden of nodal disease given +R axillary FNA and multiple concerning LN on imaging.  Regardless of next steps, she will receive at minimum 5, but more likely 10 years of hormonal therapy with an aromatase inhibitor as a cornerstone of her systemic cancer therapy.  As far as chemotherapy, with her strongly HR+ low grade, lobular biology, she may derive less benefit from chemotherapy than hormone therapy, but given her disease burden we cannot say she will derive no benefit from chemotherapy.  We think it is reasonable to send molecular profiling assay (ie. ***** *****) to help determine her benefit from chemotherapy, and how to proceed, acknowledging that these assays were developed for node negative or June 12+ nodes. This can be done as part of trial screening (*****, see below) or off trial.  This can help guide what kind of neoadjuvant treatment to pursue.     Given her preference for BCT if possible, we want to do everything possible to give her a ***** acceptable result.  Also we want to assess the degree of responsiveness of her tumor to systemic therapy.  *****, a neoadjuvant systemic approach is warranted to achieve these goals.  If her ***** ends up being low risk, we may consider 4-6 months of neoadjuvant hormone therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (given post-menopausal status) in hopes that she will have a response and can be a BCT *****.   An alternate option for low risk disease would be an available neoadjuvant trial we have combining hormone therapy with a ***** alpha subunit inhibitor, which we can discuss in a future visit. I told her even if we take an ***** approach, if we find that she has extensive ***** at surgery \n she would likely still need chemotherapy.   If her ***** ends up being high risk, I would recommend ***** including ***** on ***** trial.      The patient voiced understanding and is interested in learning about ***** . She met with the coordinator today and screening consent was provided.  She was advised to let us know how she'd like to proceed, the sooner the better since it takes ~2weeks for the genomic tests to return.  She understands that ***** screening requires repeat  MRI breast and repeat biopsy.    -PET/CT ordered  -await ***** as part of ***** screening, or ***** if she ***** not to screen for ISPY.  -will schedule repeat MRI breast and biopsy if she ***** to screen for ISPY  -F/U with Dr. *****       This pt was seen and discussed with attending ***** *****.    1.

Physical Exam:  This was a video visit    Impression  ***** clinical prognostic stage IIIB (*****) left breast cancer, ER/PR positive, ***** negative    Assessment/Plan:  Status of disease and management recommendations were discussed at length with *****. She has a cancer that is locally advanced. The rib finding on the PET scan may or may not be a site of metastasis, but it is too subtle and too late to attempt a biopsy with high confidence. Therefore I think the stage IIIB staging is reasonable to pursue at this time. Should more convincing and accessible sites of distant metastasis present themselves in the future, this can be pursued with the appropriate diagnostic biopsies and the stage revised if necessary.    ***** has a high risk of systemic relapse and mortality from this cancer if it is managed by surgery alone, a risk that I estimate to be greater than 80%. This can be reduced by several modalities including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, bone therapy, radiotherapy, and possibly newer modalities under investigation. These were discussed individually.     Chemotherapy can substantially reduced her risk of recurrence and mortality from this cancer and was recommended. Chemotherapy can be \n administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings with equivalent benefits on long term outcomes outcomes (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). However there are certain advantages to the neoadjuvant timing. These include the opportunity to confirm the in ***** response, the powerful prognostic information provided by pathologic response status (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****), and the opportunity for salvage therapies or clinical trials should there be extensive residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ***** a high risk of relapse.  She has already started on neo-adjuvant AC/taxol chemotherapy and I concurred with this (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). This consists of 4 cycles of AC at 60/600 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks with growth factor support followed by taxol given either in 4 doses of 175mg/m2 q2weeks or in 12 weekly doses of 80mg/m2. Side effects were discussed including a potential for nausea, vomiting, alopecia, immune suppression and infections, fatigue, neuropathy. Long term sequelae include 1-2% incidence of cardiomyopathy (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****) and 0.5% incidence of secondary myeloid neoplasms (***** ***** *****).     ***** will be having surgery after the completion of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Considering her locally advanced disease, it may be wise to perform an axillary dissection, and if feasible, to identify and remove the subpectoral LNs as well. The feasibility of this is best determined by ***** and may require a repeat scan post-chemo to determine the extent of residual macroscopic disease. ***** refer to ***** at ***** should she wish to pursue surgery here.     ***** will benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy for a duration of up to 10 years. Both tamoxifen and AIs are effective with AIs showing superior efficacy \n in randomized trials (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****). Side effects of tamoxifen were discussed including potential for hot flashes, mood effects, increased incidence of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. Side effects of AIs were discussed including *****, myalgias, and potential acceleration of bone loss. Although AIs are restricted to the postmenopausal state, ***** has high risk disease and will benefit from the superior efficacy afforded by AIs. This was confirmed in the combined analysis of the SOFT and TEXT trials wherein ovarian suppression with aromatase inhibitor therapy was the optimal hormonal therapy modality in premenopausal patients (***** ***** *****). ***** will likely be peri-menopausal at the completion of chemotherapy and may require ovarian suppression for a period of time. Alternatively ***** therapy with continuous estradiol monitoring for a period of time may establish a permanent menopausal status without the need for suppression.    The bone loss associated with postmenopausal use of AIs can be ***** with anti-resorptive bone agents. In addition to beneficial effects on bone, the use of ***** or denosumab every 6 months for 3 years in post-menopausal patients with early stage breast cancer is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer recurrence (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), providing additional benefit to their use in this patient population. Side effects of zoledronic acid and denosumab were discussed including a rare risk of ***** with no cases confirmed in the *****-12 or *****-18 studies (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), but 2% in the more intense schedule of the ***** trial (***** ***** *****), and a rare risk of atypical femoral fractures at a rate of under 0.2% (***** ***** *****) with no cases confirmed in the *****-18 study (***** ***** *****). Zoledronic infusions \n can also be associated with flu-like symptoms typically with the first infusion.    In addition, we discussed the emerging role of ***** inhibitor therapy in the treatment of ER positive breast cancer. The addition of ***** inhibitors is associated with significant DFS and survival benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). Phase 3 studies in early stage breast cancer have been completed but the outcomes data are not yet available. Press releases from ***** and ***** ***** have reported mixed results for adjuvant palbociclib and abemaciclib. This may be due to differences in risk categories accrued or may be due to differences in the agents or other study designs and can only be intelligently evaluated when the data is presented or published. The ribociclib phase 3 study is open at ***** (*****) and this remains an option should it still be open to accrual when ***** reaches her hormone therapy period. Alternatively ***** inhibitors may be used off label in this high risk case with her knowledge and consent.    ***** will benefit from post-operative radiotherapy whether she ***** breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy.  The high risk nature of her disease including the extensive LN involvement portend a high risk of local relapse and mortality that can be reduced by RT even in the post-mastectomy setting (***** ***** *****). In addition to the treatment of the breast or chest wall and regional LNs, ***** may chose to treat the semi-suspicious left lateral rib lesion with stereotactic RT. Indeed the management of oligometastatic breast cancer with stereotactic radiation approaches can result in considerable durations of disease control and survival, ***** when the oligometastatic site is in bone (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** Int J Radiat ***** Biol Phys 2019; 104:1194).    ***** will be continuing her \n management at ***** and will return to us as needed for additional consultations.

She underwent left mastectomy with JP \n drain placement on 03/03/22.     1. Left breast cancer: I had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her daughter in which I reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. Today, we discussed her pathology report which demonstrates a number of favorable characteristics including high ER positivity and relatively small size of resected tumor. However, there are a number of findings including  *****-67 of 20%, lack of expression of PR, and increase in grade from the core biopsy from grade 1 to grade 2 on the surgical specimen which creates some concern that  this cancer may be more high-risk. I recommended she begin endocrine therapy for a minimum of 5 years or longer, but we will plan to get an ***** to evaluate the potential benefit of chemotherapy.     In terms of hormonal therapy, I explained that aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have improved outcomes in terms of DFS as compared to tamoxifen. I also discussed the data from *****, *****, and ***** ***** which demonstrated modest benefit of extending hormonal therapy beyond 5 years. I explained that the decision to continue the aromatase inhibitor beyond 5 years should be an individualized decision based on the patient's risk and tolerance of hormonal therapy.    I reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with an aromatase inhibitors including arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss. I explained that the joint pains are often the most difficult side effect to manage, and not infrequently, patients will switch to another aromatase inhibitor.    Plan  - Instructed patient to begin letrozole, prescription ordered.  - Ordered ***** to evaluate potential benefit of chemotherapy.

CONSULTATION PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS  Review of *****-*****-***** from ***** *****, *****, *****:    C. Stomach, biopsy:   1. Invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, \n consistent with  gastric primary; see comment.  2. Gastric mucosa with intestinal metaplasia.    COMMENT:   H&E sections show multiple fragments of gastric mucosa containing  tumor composed of irregular glands lined by atypical cells. Tumor  necrosis is present. The depth of tumor invasion cannot be assessed due  to the superficial nature of the tissue fragments. The background  demonstrates extensive ***** debris with fungal organisms and  intestinal metaplasia in gastric mucosa. ***** (HER-2 and mucicarmine)  performed by the original institution are available for review.  Mucicarmine highlights intestinal metaplasia and demonstrates minimal  luminal staining in tumor glands. HER-2 is positive (3+, scale 0-3) in  tumor cells. By report, the patient's previously resected breast  carcinoma (*****-*****) shows no ***** ***** amplification by FISH.    Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings support a  diagnosis of invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, most  consistent with a gastric primary.       Radiology:  EXAMINATION: 04/16/2017   PROCEDURE:US BREAST RIGHT    HISTORY:RIGHT BREAST *****    COMPARISON:***** ***** Healthcare System, *****, ***** DIG   DIAGNOSTIC UNILAT/R(WITH ULTRASOUND IF INDICATED), 04/16/2017, 1:35   PM.    TECHNIQUE:Right breast ultrasound was performed, with evaluation   focusing only on specific areas of concern.The breast was not   scanned in its entirety.    FINDINGS:In the lateral, 9:00 position of the right breast, near the   chest wall, a lobular 1 cm hypoechoic mass is identified. This is   best seen with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position   with the breast falling forward. There is posterior acoustic   shadowing. This lesion corresponds to the mammographic abnormalities.    CONCLUSION:Ultrasound defined a lobular, 1 cm hypoechoic shadowing   lesion in the 9:00 position of the right breast, near the chest wall.   This \n corresponds to mammographic abnormalities. This is suspicious   for malignancy. An ultrasound guided core needle biopsy is   recommended.   The findings and recommendations were discussed with the patient.

Post-procedure instructions were given both orally and in written   form.    CONCLUSION:Status post ultrasound-guided vacuum assisted core needle   biopsy of a solid mass in the 9:00 position of the right breast.A   tissue marker was left at the site of biopsy.      04/19/2017 TTE Conclusions:  Image quality was fair. The patient's blood pressure was 125 mmHg/60 mmHg during the study. The heart rate during the study was 71. Spectral Doppler was utilized for this exam. Color Flow Doppler was utilized for this exam.  1. The left ventricular volume is small. LV function is borderline to mildly decreased. LV ejection fraction is is estimated to be 50 to 55%. There is no left ventricular hypertrophy. No segmental wall motion abnormalities present.  2. The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal.  3. Left atrial size is normal. Right atrial size is normal.  4. There is no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  5. There is Doppler evidence of impaired LV relaxation. LV filling pressure is likely normal.  6. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure cannot be determined due to the lack of a complete ***** jet.  7. No pericardial effusion noted. The inferior vena cava is small with spontaneous collapse consistent with hypovolemia.  8. Aortic root \n dimension is normal.      Assessment / Plan:   Ms. ***** ***** is a 68 y.o. female with a h/o knee *****, metastatic HER-2 positive gastric cancer s/p *****/trastuzumab x 12 cycles and maintenance Herceptin (completed November 2016) now in *****, February 2016 RUL PE s/p lovenox, and a March 2017 diagnosis of a stage IIB T2N1M0 R breast IDC (2.5 cm, grade 2, ER+/PR+/HER- with FISH ratio 1.1, ***** 15%) s/p 07/12/17 bilateral simple mastectomies and right axillary *****, who presents to establish Oncology care.    Ms. ***** has stage IIB IDC, an early stage breast cancer, with involvement of 1 lymph node.  She has completed bilateral mastectomies and at this time does not require radiation therapy.  Given her positive hormone status, she should be treated with an aromatase inhibitor.  However, it is unclear at this time if she would also benefit from chemotherapy.  Given her node positive status, it would be helpful to obtain ***** or ***** testing on her tumor to determine if she is high or low risk, which would then help guide management decisions about the role of chemotherapy.  Due to her current marginal functional status, history of chemotherapy with *****/Herceptin ***** cycles and borderline reduced EF (50-55%) on her last TTE, we would not choose an anthracycline based regimen for systemic chemotherapy.  Instead, we would pursue treatment with TC in the setting of high-risk disease as determined by the previously mentioned testing.    We discussed the possibility of only using an ***** vs using TC then an ***** with the patient and her daughter today.  They are in agreement to pursue further tumor testing and she was consented for ***** today.      Plan:  - patient consented and order submitted for ***** testing  - will consider the use of ***** alone vs TC then ***** based on the testing results  - patient to follow-up in 3 weeks to discuss future treatment options    All of the patient's questions and \n concerns were discussed and answered to her satisfaction.

F with a new diagnosis of high-grade ER-/PR-/*****+ IDC with spread to axillary lymph nodes, here for a second opinion.     We discussed staging with reference \n to the available mammogram report, PET/CT report, and the pathology report describing findings of carcinoma in April 30 biopsied LNs as well as associated tumor grade and receptor status as above. Overall, based on a primary tumor size of 2.1cm, high tumor grade, involvement of axillary lymph nodes, receptor status, and lack of evidence of metastatic spread, this cancer is a stage II-III (*****-3fM0), pending axillary LN analysis on resection.    We next discussed treatment.  In general it has been thought that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may offer the opportunity to downstage a tumor prior to resection and thus facilitate breast conservation, with no difference in ***** or OS vs ***** surgery. However, new evidence is emerging regarding the efficacy of adjuvant ***** targeted therapy in the setting of residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment (***** 2019;380:617-28), with improved DFS and a trend towards improved OS. Therefore, we recommend neoadjuvant treatment.    There are multiple reasonable regimens, although we suggest TCHP (docetaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks for 6 cycles with concurrent ***** and pertuzumab) or ***** (weekly paclitaxel with carboplatin, administered every three weeks or weekly, with concurrent trastuzumab and pertuzumab). Adjuvant treatment selection will be guided by an assessment of tumor response at resection, including the potential option ***** cycles of *****-***** emtansine if there is not a complete response to neoadjuvant therapy.    We briefly discussed treatment side effects including hair loss, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and risk of infection, but left a full discussion for formal chemotherapy teaching.    We also discussed the need for radiation therapy and surgical resection. We will refer Ms. ***** to the UCSF Breast Surgery clinic for consultation regarding surgical resection.

PATHOLOGY AND GENOMICS:  See extended problem list above    Assessment and Plan      ***** ***** is a 52 y.o. female with a recent diagnosis of right breast cancer (s/p right lumpectomy with 2.2cm grade 2 IDC ER+/PR+/*****-, February 27 *****, ***** 5), here to discuss adjuvant therapy.     First, we reviewed her pathology which showed 2.2cm grade 2 IDC ER+/PR+/*****-, February 27 *****. We explained that this is a highly curable cancer and we hope to reduce the risk of recurrence with adjuvant therapies.    For locoregional therapy, she already underwent right breast lumpectomy with IORT. Given her positive LN, she is scheduled for adjuvant radiation therapy with Dr. *****.     For systemic control and prevention of future breast cancer recurrence, we discussed the importance of endocrine therapy at length. ***** thinks that she is post-menopausal but we will get an estradiol now to check, and then repeat again on treatment in 3-6 months. Assuming her estradiol is negative, we will start an aromatase inhibitor and prescribed exemestane today. We prefer an aromatase inhibitor over tamoxifen in her case given that is stabilized on duloxetine which ***** with tamoxifen, she already has fatty liver disease with slightly elevated LFTs, and her clot risk may be higher due to her relative immobility. We reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with aromatase inhibitors including but not limited to arthralgias, increased risk of bone thinning/osteoporosis, urogenital symptoms, hot flashes, fatigue, hair thinning, vaginal dryness, and mood lability. We discussed that she has baseline joint pain due to her fibromyalgia, so we will monitor this closely. She is already on duloxetine which has been shown to help, and is on celebrex as well. We recommend NSAIDs for joint pain \n if needed.     In terms of deciding whether she would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, we discussed the value of ***** score in making this decision.Given her low ***** score of 5, we do not recommend chemotherapy in her case.     Recommendations:  # Breast cancer  -- Baseline labs now including estradiol, hep serologies given elevated LFTs  -- Prescribed exemestane, which she can start after estradiol confirms post-menopausal status  -- Proceed with adjuvant radiation therapy  -- In the future: DEXA scan (will need to discuss plan for scan as described below)  -- Check estradiol again in 3-6 months to ensure still in menopause    # Anxiety/PTSD  ***** has severe anxiety/PTSD for which she is followed by Dr. ***** *****. Lying on her back and enclosed places/scans can cause severe anxiety. She does not need any scans now, but we will keep this is mind for the future  -- Communicated with her outpatient psychiatrist Dr. ***** ***** via email  -- Continue home duloxetine, celebrex    # Right axilla erythema c/w fungal infection   -- Recommended anti-fungal topical for suspected fungal infection in right armpit; instructed her to let us know if worsening      Spent a total of 70 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    The patient was seen and discussed with attending physician Dr. ***** *****. *****, MD.     ***** *****, MD PGY-6  Hematology/Oncology Fellow    09/22/20    ATTESTATION:      My date of service is 09/22/2020. I was physically present for key portions of the visit and am personally involved \n in the management of the patient. I reviewed, verified, and revised the note as necessary.     52 yo woman with new right breast cancer and a number of co-morbidities here to discuss rx options.    06/01/2020 she had a screen detected right breast abnormality that was grade 2 IDC, ER/PR+ and *****- with ***** 10-12%.  An ***** before surgery was 5.  She could not tolerate an MRI due to PTSD/anxiety.    On 08/27/20 she had a lumpectomy and ***** with IORT for a 2.2 cm grade 2 IDC with associated DCIS and 1/1 positive nodes, with 1.1 cm of disease.  ER/PR+ and ***** now 15%.    Dr. ***** recommended radiation therapy for 3 weeks, with sedation for her simulation due to anxiety.    PMH includes morbid obesity, hepatic steatosis, IBS, fibromyalgia, arthritis, anxiety, borderline HTN.  Actively treated by psychiatry, on cymbalta and celebrex.  She is taking ***** for hot flashes.    Married, lives with her husband G0P0.  Amenorrheic since age 50.    On exam her surgical incision is well healed, she has a rash in the right axilla.    I reviewed and interpreted her pathology, imaging and labs as summarized above and here.  Her labs labs were July 23 and showed a mild elevation in ***** and alk phos    IMP  52 yo woman with unknown menopausal status and newly diagnosed T2N1, stage IIb, HR+ disease with low ***** score and multiple medical problems.  We discussed risk of recurrence from her node positive disease, and the use of endocrine therapy.  We are concerned about the drug interaction with tamoxifen and cymbalta and the joint pains with aromatase inhibitors.  In addition, she would not be able to have a bone density as she is not able to tolerate scans.    Discussed in detail    1. Proceed with radiation therapy - will start end of September 29. Laboratory studies including an estradiol, vitamin D, hepatitis serologies  3. If she is menopause, we could try an ***** - perhaps starting with exemestane.  Cymbalta has been shown \n to reduce joint pains with AIs as well.    Plan to check labs, then start aromatase inhibitor, with ***** about 8 weeks later.    I spent a total of 75 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    ***** *****. *****, MD  09/22/2020      \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

Restaging evaluation/assessment of response to therapy.    COMPARISON: Prior PET/CT at ***** ***** ***** Imaging Center on 10/31/2019. A CT of the   chest, abdomen, and pelvis on 12/06/2019 and a whole body bone scan on 11/21/2019 are also   reviewed.    TECHNIQUE: At the time of this study, the patient's fasting blood glucose was 93 mg/dL and her   weight was 199 lbs. Approximately 70 minutes after the intravenous administration of 12.0 mCi   of 18-FDG, PET emission images and CT (dose-limited, without CT contrast) transmission images   were acquired from the top of the head to the mid thighs. The PET images were subsequently   corrected for tissue attenuation, fused with the CT images, and reconstructed for review in   orthogonal and 3D rotating (MIP) projections.  (CT dose information: CTDIvol = 9.9 mGy, DLP = 956.50 mGy-cm)    FINDINGS:  Head and Neck: There is relatively symmetric physiologic brain \n activity (though evaluation of   the brain on this study is limited). There is physiologic tonsillar, salivary gland, and oral   activity. There is mild atherosclerotic calcification of the carotid arteries, left slightly   greater than right. There is no discrete or intense thyroid hypermetabolism, nor intensely   hypermetabolic adenopathy within the neck.    Thorax: There is persistent subtle irregularity/nodularity of the bilateral breast tissues,   similar to prior study. In particular, there is an approximately 1.4 cm faintly hypermetabolic   density within the right lateral breast on CT images 119-***** with SUV 1.0 (previously similar   in size with SUV 0.8). There are other very faintly hypermetabolic nodular densities within   the both breasts, including an approximately 1 cm density within the right superolateral breast   (CT image 104, SUV 1.2) and an approximately 2 cm elongated density within the left lateral   breast (CT images 124-*****, SUV 1.3). These findings also appear relatively stable from prior   study. There are no definitive new or intensely hypermetabolic breast lesions on either side.    The numerous hypermetabolic right axillary and right subpectoral lymph nodes seen previously   has significantly improved with interval therapy. For example, there is a residual 2.1 x 1.0   cm right axillary node with an internal biopsy clip/marker on CT image 90 with SUV 1.9   (previously 2.3 x 1.5 cm with SUV 15.1), as well as a residual 1.2 x 1.0 cm right lateral   subpectoral node on CT images 83-84 with SUV 1.8 (previously 1.8 x 1.6 cm with SUV 9.6). There   are other scattered residual right axillary and right subpectoral nodes that have similarly   significantly declined in size from prior study, and now demonstrate little (if any)   appreciable metabolic activity. These findings are consistent with extensive locoregional   nodal metastatic disease that has substantially improved with \n interval therapy. Scattered   small, faintly hypermetabolic left axillary lymph nodes are most likely benign/reactive. There   is no significant hypermetabolic internal mammary, hilar, or mediastinal adenopathy.    There is a persistent Port-A-Cath within the left anterior upper thoracic wall (distal catheter   tip near *****/right atrial junction). Within the lungs, there are scattered areas of presumed   atelectasis or inflammation, particularly in the right thoracic paravertebral region (e.g. on   CT images 77-80 and 79-102), as well as presumed atelectasis or mild inflammation within the   lingula. Conversely, a prior hazy/ground-glass opacity within the posterior right lower lobe   has diminished or resolved. There are probable tiny, partially-calcified scars/granulomas   within the left apex laterally (CT image 76) and at the left posterior lung base (CT image   119), also seen previously. There is mild probable left apical scarring (CT image 71), as well   as a suspected tiny (3-4 mm) nodule within the right medial lung apex (CT image 74). There is   significant respiratory motion, limiting evaluation for other potential small/tiny lung   nodules. However, there are no discretely or intensely hypermetabolic lung nodules or masses.    There are no substantial pleural or pericardial effusions. There is suggestion of a small   hiatal hernia. The heart appears borderline/mildly enlarged, with mild coronary arterial   atherosclerotic calcification.    Abdomen and Pelvis: There is physiologic hepatic and splenic metabolic activity, with mildly   asymmetric elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The gallbladder is not well evaluated on this   study, with suspected cholelithiasis (better seen previously). There is no significant   abnormal adrenal or pancreatic hypermetabolism. There is no evidence of an abdominal aortic   aneurysm.    There is physiologic GI activity, with relatively prominent, \n non-discrete proximal colonic   activity most likely reflecting normal variation. There is extensive stool within the rectum.    There is physiologic urinary radiotracer excretion, with moderate bilateral renal cortical   scarring. There is no definitive abnormal uterine hypermetabolism. The lower pelvis is again   suboptimally visualized on low-dose CT due to extensive streak artifacts from the patient's   right hip prosthesis. Small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes are likely benign/reactive, with no   intensely hypermetabolic subdiaphragmatic adenopathy.    Musculoskeletal: There is relatively prominent muscle tension/strain in the left subscapular   region and adjacent to both hips. There are other scattered areas of presumed subcutaneous   inflammation or edema, particularly within the patient's pannus bilaterally, lower back, and   right lateral upper thigh. There is also more prominent stranding/inflammation of the   subcutaneous fat in the left lateral abdominal and flank regions (e.g. on CT images 134-*****).   This is new from prior study, and may reflect interval trauma to this region.    There are chronic degenerative changes of the skeleton, with stable mild spinal scoliosis.   There is a persistent indwelling right hip prosthesis. There are persistent post-surgical   changes within the lower lumbar spine and left humeral head, as well as probable post-surgical   changes of the right posterior ilium (e.g. a bone graft donor site). There are probable   old/healed rib injuries (e.g. within the right posterior ribcage), as well as probable new   traumatic injury/fracture of the left 12th rib (SUV 3.7). Prior activity near the left   posterior acetabulum/ischium has resolved. A prior discrete focus of hypermetabolism within   the right inferior L5 vertebra (near the right lumbosacral junction) has also resolved, as has   prior hypermetabolism within the left posterior third rib and right posterior \n ninth rib. These   prior findings were equivocal, with limited, treated/resolved (by metabolism) skeletal   metastatic disease not entirely excluded. However, there is currently felt to be no definitive   metabolic evidence of active skeletal metastatic disease.    For reference/comparison purposes, blood pool activity within the descending thoracic aorta (at   the level of the carina) demonstrates an approximate SUV of 2.0 currently and 2.2 previously.

The apparent limited FDG avidity of this patient's primary breast cancer limits its   evaluation by this imaging technique.    2.  Prior extensive locoregional nodal metastatic disease in the right axillary and right   subpectoral regions has substantially improved with interval therapy.  A few residual   borderline-enlarged, faintly hypermetabolic lymph nodes in these areas suggest potential   limited residual nodal metastatic disease.    3.  New probable inflammatory changes within the left lateral abdominal wall/flank soft   tissues, with a new probable injury/fracture of the left 12th rib.  There are probable   superimposed old/healed rib injuries.  A few other equivocal skeletal finding seen previously   have resolved (metabolically), with limited treated/resolved skeletal metastatic disease not   entirely excluded.    4.  Probable combination of scars/granulomas and atelectatic changes within the lungs, as   detailed above.    5.  Other likely-benign findings, as detailed above.

We had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her daughter which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. First, we reviewed *****'s pathology confirming that she has metastatic breast cancer which is estrogen receptor positive \n and ***** negative based on core needle biopsy of an axillary LN in November 2019. She presented with extensive lytic bone lesions at that time. She has since developed metastatic disease to the liver and pachymeninges and possibly to the leptomeninges, although her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. We explained that metastatic breast cancer is not curable, but it is treatable and there are therapies that will extend the quality and duration of life.     We reviewed her treatment course to date. She was initially started on letrozole/palbociclib in December 2019, but this was discontinued due to PD to the liver and LN in July 2020. WE assured ***** that this was an appropriate treatment choice as initial therapy of *****+/*****- metastatic disease. Upon progression, she was switched to Xeloda (initially 500mg BID inadvertantly, then 1000mg BID in mid-September, and 1500 mg BID since late September).     She recently had brain MRIs on 09/29/20 and again on 11/07/20, which showed diffuse irregular ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region as well as *****'s ***** The more recent scan showed possibly worsening of disease in the internal auditory canal, which would be consistent with her recent right hearing loss.  We tried to explain to the patient and family the difference between ***** based/***** disease and leptomeningeal disease and stressed that it can be very difficulty radiographically to distinguish the two. While her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells, her radiographic and clinical findings raise suspicion for leptomeningeal disease.    Recently, her neurologic symptoms are getting progressively worse, with no improvement in her vision and now auditory symptoms. Despite her initial CSF cytology being negative, we explained that  false negatives are not uncommon and we recommend repeat LP with cytology now. We also recommend referral to \n radiation oncology for consideration of radiation therapy (either just to her internal auditory canal or to a larger portion of her *****). We would also consider starting low dose steroids to see if this improves her symptoms.     In terms of future options, if a CT CAP shows clear progression on Xeloda, we would consider another hormone-based therapy strategy. We would consider fulvestrant plus the ***** inhibitor ***** (*****) (***** ***** 2019), given her known ***** mutation on Strata testing. In this study, in the cohort of patients with *****-mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months in the *****-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group. However, this regimen does not have great CNS penetration, but there are few regimens that do.    Given that she has metastatic disease to the bone, we agree with continuing zolendronic acid    Recommendations:  -- Repeat CT CAP now  -- Repeat LP for CSF cytology  -- Repeat MRI spine to r/o LMD in the spine  -- Recommend referral to radiation oncology to consider either focal CNS radiation or possible even *****. The patient is interested in a UCSF Rad Onc opinion as well.  -- Could consider starting low dose steroids to see if reduction of swelling improves any of her symptoms  -- Continue xeloda 1500mg BID for now  -- At time of progression of disease, could consider fulvestrant + ***** given the ***** mutation on STRATA testing  -- Continue zolendronic acid    Patient seen and discussed with breast oncology attending *****. ***** *****.    ***** *****, MD PGY-5  Hematology/Oncology Fellow    \n \nList of clinical medications:\n["}], "max_tokens": 250, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

The tumor grade was assessed as 2.    A long discussion with Ms. ***** about the general approach to the treatment of primary breast cancer with the use of surgery and radiation to remove the tumor from the chest wall and prevent its recurrence locally as well as the use of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy as systemic therapy peak to prevent distant metastatic recurrence.given the tumor parameters mentioned above I assessed th at she had a reasonably high risk of breast cancer recurrence in the range of about 40-45%.I discussed the process of risk estimation with her and the various parameters that we use to assess  risk she seemed to understand as well.  Ms. ***** that it would be very reasonable to pursue a course of hormonal therapy to decrease the risk of metastatic recurrence and that the risk-benefit ratio for hormonal treatment would be favorable. Although I believe there would be some benefit from a course of chemotherapy in this case I believe her age (even though she appears vigorous for her stated age) and her history of Parkinson's disease would make the risk benefit ratio for a course of chemotherapy less favorable.  Since a course of chemotherapy added to a course of hormonal therapy only give her an additional benefit of 3-4% I suggested I could not strongly recommend a course of chemotherapy that would be a personal decision will depend on how aggressively she wanted to approach his situation with Ms. ***** told me that she was leaning against the course of chemotherapy and would prefer to receive a course of hormonal therapy alone and I to initiate therapy could support her in that decision.

We had a lengthy discussion with the patient in which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. We \n reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports.     We discussed the use of locoregional therapies to reduce risk of locoregional disease and the use of systemic therapies to primarily reduce risk of systemic recurrence, which can potentially be incurable.     Because she has HR+ disease, she will need at least 5 years of hormonal therapy. Data from *****/TEXT trial demonstrated that patient who were premenopausal at their breast cancer diagnosis and recovered ovarian function after completion of chemotherapy, the combination of ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor was superior to tamoxifen in terms of preventing distant recurrence. However, given the low grade and low proliferation rate of her tumor, we do not believe she will benefit chemotherapy. We discussed that molecular tests such as ***** can be helpful for situations where the decision regarding chemotherapy may not be as clear. She is interested in her ***** score and we will order. In the meantime she can proceed with radiation consult and sim, not to start xrt until after ***** result comes back.    Given she is pre-menopausal, and has a low grade/low proliferation tumor, we would recommend she start with tamoxifen after completion of adjuvant radiation. If her ***** test is in the higher end of intermediate we can discuss the potential benefit of *****/*****, otherwise tamoxifen will likely be sufficient.     We discussed the importance of exercise - at least 150min of aerobic exercises per week, weight bearing exercises at least 2x a week, and to reduce alcohol and sugar/***** intake.       Plan  - ***** send for ***** testing  - Proceed with adjuvant radiation consult, wait to start xrt until after ***** comes back.  - Tamoxifen after completion of adjuvant radiation       RTC after radiation to discuss hormone therapy in greater detail.

The patient's breast cancer history began in early 2009 when she was diagnosed with a locally advanced left-sided breast cancer.  She underwent a left modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection on 08/12/2008.  The pathology revealed a 2.6 cm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma.  There was also ductal carcinoma in situ, and lymphovascular invasion was present.  August 25 lymph nodes were involved with metastatic carcinoma, with the largest metastatic deposit measuring 1.6 cm, and presence of extracapsular extension.  According to the notes provided by the referring physician, the invasive cancer was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive, and HER-2/neu negative.  The patient completed 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 4 cycles of Taxol given in a dose dense fashion in December 2008.  The patient completed chest wall radiation in February 2009 and then initiated tamoxifen in March 2009.  Menses stopped during chemo and then came back briefly, and then stopped completely after about 6 months of tamoxifen.     The patient underwent a prophylactic right mastectomy on 07/09/2010.  Pathology incidentally found a 0.6 cm invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu 3+ by immunohistochemistry.  There was also associated ductal carcinoma in situ.  The patient decided against an axillary lymph node dissection.  She underwent a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on 08/03/2010 which did not reveal any evidence of distant metastatic disease. She was treated with adjuvant Taxol and trastuzumab given weekly for 12 weeks between 09/22/2010 through 12/22/2010.  She experienced a drop in ***** and Herceptin was discontinued after a total of 12 \n weeks. According to the notes provided by the referring physician, the patient tolerated this treatment poorly.  The patient has been followed by a cardiologist and was started on Coreg. Her EF improved from 50% up to 60%. Coreg was discontinued after 6 months, and her last EF by ***** was 56%. She is due for a follow up *****. In terms of hormonal therapies, the patient continued on Tamoxifen until May 2012. She then switched to anastrozole, and experienced joint pains so she was switched to letrozole.     In terms of recent symptoms, the patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on 12/14/2011 for evaluation of intense abdominal pain and diarrhea. She was diagnosed with diverticulitis and was given antibiotics.The patient reports having left chest wall pain both internally and externally starting about 6 months ago. She brought this to the attention of her oncologist and she underwent a PET CT scan on 06/09/2012 which revealed a new left lung mass as well as mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  According to the notes from the referring physician, her case was discussed at the ***** multidisciplinary tumor board and a biopsy of the left lung mass was recommended.  According to the notes provided by her prior oncologist, the patient apparently declined the biopsy, either CT-guided or surgical, and proceeded with treatment with fulvestrant. The patient reports that she considered the biopsy but was in the process of trying to transfer care to UCSF. She states that she intended to have the biopsy performed, but would prefer to have it done at *****.  Since that time, the patient experienced an episode of chest pain in late July and was seen by several MDs. She was prescribed an anti-inflammatory patch which did not help. She then saw her cardiologist who did not think it was cardiac in nature.     The patient that underwent a followup PET/CT scan performed at the ***** facility in *****, ***** on August 20, \n 2013.  This scan revealed an interval decrease in the mediastinal lymphadenopathy since the prior exam with an enlarged AP window node measuring 11 mm as compared to the prior measurement of 15 mm in short axis.  However there was a new AP window lymph node with market hypermetabolic activity.  Additionally the mass within the lingula of the lung measured 3.4 x 2.2 cm as compared to the prior measurement of 2.9 x 2 cm.  Within the abdomen and pelvis, heterogeneous uptake was noted with defects in the liver suggestive of cysts.  The scan also revealed diverticulosis with no findings of diverticulitis.  There was a ***** defect within the right adnexa likely representing an ovarian cyst.  There was heterogeneous bone marrow uptake noted with no hypermetabolic activity to suggest metastatic disease.    The patient now presents to UCSF for ongoing treatment recommendations and would like to proceed with the biopsy of the lung lesion. She reports having continued chest pain, similar to that which she experienced in July. She reports having a high pain tolerance but at times this pain is the worst she has ever experienced. She denies any fevers or chills. She has no nausea or vomiting, significant cough or dyspnea associated with the chest pain. She is accompanied today by her father who seems extremely supportive.

The patient was then diagnosed with metastatic disease in June 2012 based on imaging findings including mediastinal adenopathy and a left lung mass.  The patient has not \n had a pathologic diagnosis of metastatic disease, but was instead started on treatment in the form of fulvestrant.  A followup scan in August 2012 showed increase in size of the lung lesion but modest decrease in the size of the mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Based on the increasing chest pain being experienced by the patient, I am highly suspicious that the lung lesion is progressing further, and the subpleural thickening in the anterior left lower lobe likely represents progression of disease as well.  At this point, in order to make the most appropriate treatment recommendations, I fully agree with the ***** medical oncology group that the patient needs to have a biopsy of either the pulmonary nodule, mediastinal adenopathy, or the area of subpleural thickening that might represent another site of metastatic disease.  I explained to the patient that I do not know what is the ***** approach to biopsy one or more of these lesions, and that we will need a followup CT scan which has contrast and thin slices in order to better understand the extent of disease, since the CT scan from 08/18/2012 was noncontrast and used for anatomic localization only.  In the meantime, I have submitted a referral to both interventional radiology as well as thoracic surgery to determine what is the best route for biopsy of her disease.    The patient understands that I cannot make a comprehensive treatment recommendation until I know the biological characteristics of her metastatic disease.  If her cancer remains estrogen receptor positive, it would be reasonable to consider ongoing hormonal therapy, but most likely combined with a biological therapy such as the combination of Exemestane and Afinitor. We would also entertain the possibility of a chemotherapy such as Xeloda which could have reasonable efficacy as well as allow the patient to maintain a decent quality of life. Alternatively, if the metastatic disease is hormone receptor \n negative, we will need to switch to chemotherapy to control her disease.  We will also discuss a variety of clinical trials combining combinations of chemotherapy with biological therapy.    In terms of symptom management, recent episodes of chest pain have been extremely intense for the patient, and she certainly needs a comprehensive review of pain management strategies.  I have placed a referral to our symptom management service so that they can focused their attention entirely on symptom management while I sort out what is the best treatment for her metastatic cancer. He will return to clinic in approximately 2 weeks, and hopefully by that time she will have had the chest CT, seen the thoracic surgeon, and her need by interventional radiology.
