The tumors were G2,  ER and PR positive and her 2 neu negative.  She did not have radiation or chemotherapy and declined tamoxifen.  She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. \n ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.  We discussed how treatment would be palliative but that treatment could improve her quality of life as well as length of life.  She asked me multiple times if this can be cured.

The T-scores of her lumbar spine and femur are stable from last year which is in the osteopenia range. Advised patient to continue calcium and Vitamin D supplements and to continue weight bearing exercises. ***** continue monitor DEXA scan. If the patient's BMD falls below -2.5, she will need to see a dentist, then we could start the her on Prolia 60 mg SQ every 6 months.

Assessment and Plan:    ***** ***** is a 75 y.o. female with ER+/PR+/***** negative left breast invasive ductal carcinoma. On 10/29/16 she underwent a left mastectomy with SLN biopsy. She is currently on Letrozole since 12/02/2016.     1. Breast Cancer. The patient is without any evidence of disease recurrence on imaging, exam, and review of systems. Her leg, upper back, and arm pain are better after completing physical therapy. We discussed alarming signs and symptoms and when to seek care. She will continue to take Letrozole 2.5 mg daily. She will continue annual right breast mammogram, next due July 2019 (Chinese Hospital *****).     2. Occasional muscle cramping, improved with stretching/exercises. Continue exercises and muscle stretching. She can consider taking OTC Magnesium supplement.     3. Upper left back pain due to muscle tightness. Recc heat, massage, and ibuprofen. This improved \n after completing physical therapy.     4. Left buttock and anterior thigh pain, stable and likely due to OA. Recc heat, massage, and ibuprofen. This improved after completing physical therapy.     5. Osteoporosis, currently on *****. The patient's baseline bone density scan showed osteoporosis in the low back. She had a repeat bone density scan last July 2018 which showed slight improvement of bone density at the femur neck with T-score (-2.4) now in the osteopenia range. The T-scores of her lumbar spine and femur are stable from last year which is in the osteopenia range. Advised patient to continue calcium and Vitamin D supplements and to continue weight bearing exercises. ***** continue monitor DEXA scan. If the patient's BMD falls below -2.5, she will need to see a dentist, then we could start the her on Prolia 60 mg SQ every 6 months. We can check again her DEXA in 1 year to assess change, due July 2019.     6. Headaches, intermittent, chronic: Seek care if worsening. Advised to follow-up with PCP. If worsening, consider brain MRI.     7. Loose stools, grade 1, mostly after meals. Discussed trying daily probiotics.        Follow up in 6 months or sooner if she has new or worsening symptoms.     I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 30 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options.         \n \n Summary: \n"}], "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}

Assessment and Plan:    ***** ***** is a 75 y.o. female with ER+/PR+/***** negative left breast invasive ductal carcinoma. On 10/29/16 she underwent a left mastectomy with SLN biopsy. She is currently on Letrozole since 12/02/2016.     1. Breast Cancer. The patient is without any evidence of disease recurrence on imaging, exam, and review of systems. Her leg, upper back, and arm pain are better after completing physical therapy. We discussed alarming signs and symptoms and when to seek care. She will continue to take Letrozole 2.5 mg daily. She will continue annual right breast mammogram, next due July 2019 (Chinese Hospital *****).     2. Occasional muscle cramping, improved with stretching/exercises. Continue exercises and muscle stretching. She can consider taking OTC Magnesium supplement.     3. Upper left back pain due to muscle tightness. Recc heat, massage, and ibuprofen. This improved \n after completing physical therapy.     4. Left buttock and anterior thigh pain, stable and likely due to OA. Recc heat, massage, and ibuprofen. This improved after completing physical therapy.     5. Osteoporosis, currently on *****. The patient's baseline bone density scan showed osteoporosis in the low back. She had a repeat bone density scan last July 2018 which showed slight improvement of bone density at the femur neck with T-score (-2.4) now in the osteopenia range. The T-scores of her lumbar spine and femur are stable from last year which is in the osteopenia range. Advised patient to continue calcium and Vitamin D supplements and to continue weight bearing exercises. ***** continue monitor DEXA scan. If the patient's BMD falls below -2.5, she will need to see a dentist, then we could start the her on Prolia 60 mg SQ every 6 months. We can check again her DEXA in 1 year to assess change, due July 2019.     6. Headaches, intermittent, chronic: Seek care if worsening. Advised to follow-up with PCP. If worsening, consider brain MRI.     7. Loose stools, grade 1, mostly after meals. Discussed trying daily probiotics.        Follow up in 6 months or sooner if she has new or worsening symptoms.     I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 30 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options.         \n \n Summary: \n"}], "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}}
