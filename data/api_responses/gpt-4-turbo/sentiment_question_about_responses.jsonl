Romidepsin is classified as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor.\n\n### Mechanism of Action:\nRomidepsin works by inhibiting the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs are enzymes involved in modifying proteins that help structure DNA, known as histones, which affects gene expression. By inhibiting these enzymes, romidepsin increases the acetylation of histones, leading to an open chromatin structure and affecting gene expression in a way that can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and inhibit tumor growth.\n\n### Uses:\n- **Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CT"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 36, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 236}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_f17df3916f"}}, "error": null}

Created by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Adstiladrin was approved in December 2022. It is designed as a novel gene therapy to reduce the recurrence of bladder cancer in affected patients.\n\nThe therapy works by delivering a modified form of the adenovirus carrying the gene for interferon alfa-2b directly into the bladder via a catheter. Once inside the bladder, the virus infects the cells, causing them to produce interferon alfa-2b, a protein that has antitumor effects. This locally produced interferon can help trigger the immune system to fight cancer cells, thereby aiming to control or eliminate the tumor.\n\nAdst"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 37, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 237}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_fe1929285d"}}, "error": null}

TIGIT is an immune checkpoint that can inhibit the immune response, so by blocking this checkpoint, tiragolumab aims to enhance the body's natural immune responses against cancer.\n\nIt is in clinical trials for treating various types of cancer, often in combination with other therapies such as atezolizumab, another immunotherapy drug that targets the PD-L1 protein.
