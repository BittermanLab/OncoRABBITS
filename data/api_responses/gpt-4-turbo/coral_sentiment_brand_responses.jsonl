In this patient's case, it's prescribed as needed before MRI, biopsy, and health appointments.\n   - **Side Effects**: Can include drowsiness, light-headedness, and cognitive impairment. There's also the potential for dependence and withdrawal symptoms if used regularly over a long period.

There's also an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures since it can accelerate bone density loss.\n\n2. **Palbociclib**: This medication is a CDK4/6 inhibitor that works by stopping cancer cells from dividing and growing. It is used in combination with hormonal therapies like Letrozole.\n\n   - **Side effects**: The most notable side effect is myelosuppression, particularly neutropenia (a low level of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections). Regular blood tests are required to monitor this.
