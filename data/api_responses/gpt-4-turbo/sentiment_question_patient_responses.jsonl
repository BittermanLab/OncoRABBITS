Asparaginase depletes this amino acid, thereby starving and ultimately killing the cancer cells.\n\n### 2. **Forms and Administration**\n   Asparaginase is available in different forms, including:\n   - **Native E. coli asparaginase**\n   - **Pegylated asparaginase** (a modified"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 43, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 243}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_fe1929285d"}}, "error": null}

By blocking this enzyme, abiraterone helps lower testosterone levels further, which can slow the growth of prostate cancer.\n\n3. **Administration**: It is usually taken in the form of a pill. It's important to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions on how to take this medication.
