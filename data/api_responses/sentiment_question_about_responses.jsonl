This mechanism is particularly useful in APL, where it helps to promote the maturation of abnormal white blood cells into normal cells.\n\nTamibarotene is often considered when patients are resistant to or cannot tolerate all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), another retinoid used in the treatment of APL. It has shown efficacy in inducing remission in patients with relapsed or refractory APL.\n\nThe drug is generally administered orally and has a different side effect profile compared to ATRA, which can make it a preferable option for some patients.

In patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, the cancer cells are particularly dependent on EGFR signaling for their growth and survival, making them more susceptible to the inhibitory effects of gefitinib.\n\n### Administration\nGefitinib is taken orally, usually in the form of a tablet.
