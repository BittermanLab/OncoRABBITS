It works by blocking the activity of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply, thereby slowing or stopping the spread of cancer cells.\n\n2. How to Take It: Alectinib is taken orally, usually twice a day. It should be taken with food and consumed around the same time each day.\n\n3. Side Effects: Side effects may include fatigue, constipation, edema, muscle pain, anemia, changes in liver function tests, and others.
