The diphtheria toxin part is designed to kill those cells upon internalization.\n\n### Administration\n- **Administration**: Tagraxofusp is given by intravenous (IV) infusion.\n- **Schedule**: Typically, it is administered on a specific schedule, often daily for a set number of days, followed by a rest"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 42, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 242}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_729ea513f7"}}, "error": null}
