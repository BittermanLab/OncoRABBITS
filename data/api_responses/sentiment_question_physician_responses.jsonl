Additionally, it inhibits the enzyme P450scc (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme), which is crucial in the first step of the synthesis of all steroid hormones.\n- **Formulation:** It is usually available in oral tablet form.\n\n### Indications:\n- **Cushing's Syndrome:** It is used to treat Cushing's syndrome by reducing the production of cortisol.\n- **Hormone-sensitive Cancers:** It has been used"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 44, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 244}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_729ea513f7"}}, "error": null}
