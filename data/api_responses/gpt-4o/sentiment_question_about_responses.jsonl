Once the antibody binds to the CD33 antigen on the leukemia cells, the entire complex is internalized by the cell.\n   - **Cell Killing**: Inside the cell, the cytotoxic agent is released, causing DNA damage and ultimately leading to cell death.\n\n2. **Indications**:\n   - Gemtuzumab"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 40, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 240}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_43dfabdef1"}}, "error": null}

This targeting helps the drug to home in on cancer cells while minimizing effects on normal cells.\n\n2. **Chemotherapy Component**: The chemotherapy drug linked to the antibody is a cytotoxic agent called calicheamicin.

This type of breast cancer is more aggressive and has a higher likelihood of recurrence than HER2-negative forms, which is why targeted treatments like pertuzumab are important.\n\nThe typical application of pertuzumab is in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, as well as in the neoadjuvant (pre-surgical) and adjuvant (post-surgical) settings for early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.
