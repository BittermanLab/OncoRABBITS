By inhibiting proteasomes, carfilzomib causes an accumulation of proteins in cancer cells, leading to cell death.\n\n2. **Administration**: Carfilnat is administered intravenously (IV). The dosage and schedule depend on various factors, including the specific treatment regimen, the stage of the disease, and the patient's overall health.\n\n3. **Side Effects**: Common side effects of carfilzomib include fatigue, nausea, fever, low blood cell counts, shortness of breath, and diarrhea.

It consists of adhesive patches (transducer arrays) that are placed on the head and connected to a portable device.\n\n### Usage:\n1. **Continuous Use:** For optimal effectiveness, Optune is typically worn for at least 18 hours a day. Consistent use is crucial for the treatment to be effective.\n2. **Daily Life:** The device is designed to be portable, allowing patients to go about their daily activities while receiving treatment.\n\n### Effectiveness"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 40, "completion_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 240}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_43dfabdef1"}}, "error": null}

By inhibiting proteasomes, Bortezomib disrupts various cellular processes, leading to cancer cell death.\n\n2. **Administration**:\n   - **Injection**: Bortezomib is usually administered by a healthcare professional. It can be given as an intravenous (IV) injection or subcutaneous injection (under the skin).\n   - **Schedule**: It is typically given in cycles, with periods of treatment followed by periods of rest.
