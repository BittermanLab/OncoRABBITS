She had a mastectomy with sentinel node and implant reconstruction in June 2013 and had  2.3 and 2.4 cm tumors found with a negative sentinel node.  The tumors were G2,  ER and PR positive and her 2 neu negative.  She did not have radiation or chemotherapy and declined tamoxifen.  She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. 
 ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.  We discussed how treatment would be palliative but that treatment could improve her quality of life as well as length of life.  She asked me multiple times if this can be cured.       I will refer her to the ***** center.  I also ordered a MRI of brain and bone scan as well as labs to complete her work up.

She had a repeat bone density scan last July 2018 which showed slight improvement of bone density at the femur neck with T-score (-2.4) now in the osteopenia range. The T-scores of her lumbar spine and femur are stable from last year which is in the osteopenia range. Advised patient to continue calcium and Vitamin D supplements and to continue weight bearing exercises. ***** continue monitor DEXA scan. If the patient's BMD falls below -2.5, she will need to see a dentist, then we could start the her on Prolia 60 mg SQ every 6 months. We can check again her DEXA in 1 year to assess change, due July 2019.     6. Headaches, intermittent, chronic: Seek care if worsening. Advised to follow-up with PCP. If worsening, consider brain MRI.     7. Loose stools, grade 1, mostly after meals. Discussed trying daily probiotics.        Follow up in 6 months or sooner if she has new or worsening symptoms.     I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 30 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options.

Left breast, mag seed-localized partial mastectomy:   1. Tumor bed with chronic inflammation.  2. Biopsy site changes.   3. Proliferative fibrocystic change with focal usual ductal hyperplasia  (*****) and sclerosing adenosis.  4. See comment.     B. Left breast, new margin, resection:   Benign breast tissue. See comment.    C. Left axillary lymph nodes, dissection:    1. Metastatic ductal carcinoma in three of twenty eight lymph nodes  (May 22).  2. Extracapsular extension.   3. Treatment effect.   4. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  5. See comment.      D. Left axillary lymph node, level 3, dissection:   1. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  2. Two of two lymph nodes with no tumor identified (0/2).   3. See comment.    COMMENT:  The partial mastectomy specimen (part A) was extensively sampled.  Sections reveal benign breast tissue with biopsy site changes and  treatment effect. To confirm the diagnosis, immunohistochemical stains  were performed on blocks A11 and A12 at ***** with the following results:  Stain     Target     Result  Keratin     Epithelial cells     Negative for invasive carcinoma (A11  and A12)  P63     Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)  SMM   
    Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)    The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings and rules against an occult invasive carcinoma in part A.     The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings. Positive staining for ***** along with positive MPO in  histiocytes is compatible with ***** ***** lymphadenitis. Positive  staining for T cell markers without loss of specific markers, favors a  non-neoplastic process. The CD30 stain highlights ***** and  negative staining for CD15 rules against Hodgkin lymphoma. B cell  markers are negative, ruling against a B cell lymphoma. Negative  staining for keratin and CD68 and ***** rules against a histiocytic  process or fulminant treatment effect in the lymph node. Overall, the  findings support a diagnosis of necrotizing lymphadenitis. The  differential diagnosis includes ***** ***** disease, which is  favored, as well as lymphadenitis secondary to systemic lupus  erythematous. Serologic testing for lupus to rule out the diagnosis is  recommended.     ***** ***** is a self-limiting auto-immune disorder which presents  as acute or sub-acute lymphadenitis over the course of several weeks.  The differential diagnosis includes T cell lymphoma, which is largely  excluded in this case by IHC staining as well as lupus which can have  similar ***** (ref 1).

I discussed with ***** in great detail the natural history and treatment of *****-/*****+ breast cancer.  We reviewed the pathology and imaging reports as well as her treatment course to date.  I have stated to ***** that she is at great risk of developing metastatic breast cancer due to her incomplete course of systemic therapy for her high risk disease.  We discussed in detail why she was unable to adhere to the standard treatment as recommended.  She states family members discouraged her from receiving chemotherapy, that she did not feel supported in the management of her symptoms due to her treatment, and that logistically she found it difficult to come in for appointments.      I reiterated to her that she is at great risk of developing metastatic breast cancer which is not curable, and that she can reduce this risk by proceeding with recommended systemic therapy of ***** followed by T-DM1.  I stated that if she were able to commit to this treatment I would do all I and my team can to provide the support she needs to manage symptoms.  I discussed with her the typical SE associated with AC, such as  fatigue, myelosuppression, nausea, hair loss, and brain fog.  Also mentioned risks of cardiomyopathy and secondary leukemia.  Briefly discussed side-effects associated with T-DM1, such as *****, bleeding, and neuropathy.      I reiterated the importance of radiation after 
 completing AC.    I have sent ***** a detailed description of AC and the steps that would need to be taken in order to start, including port placement and echocardiogram.  We will aim to speak again this coming week.  ***** states that she will consider this recommendation and also that she understands she is at great risk of MBC.    Recommendations in *****:  - adjuvant AC x 4 cycles, to be followed by T-DM1  - radiation    I spent a total of 80 minutes face-to-face with the patient and >50% of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, symptoms and therapeutic options.

There are multiple small lymph nodes in the upper abdomen. Portacaval lymph node measures up to 30 x 15 mm. Small  para-aortic lymph nodes are also present less than 1 cm. There is widespread osseous metastatic disease. Pathologic destruction of multiple ribs and extensive distraction of the sternum involving body of the sternum as well as the manubrium. There is involvement of the thoracic spine most severe at T10 where there is involvement of the vertebral body the pedicle and there is intraspinal extension along the right and lateral aspects of the canal. There is involvement of the right pedicle L1 as well.  02/10/18 MRI Lumbar spine w/ and w/o contrast: Abnormal marrow signal with replacement of normal marrow throughout the lumbosacral spine consistent with metastatic infiltration. Sacral tissues are also infiltrated. There is mild fracture of the inferior endplate of L1 on the right side. T12 inferior endplate demonstrates fracture mild loss of height as well. Epidural contrast enhancement ventrally and dorsally consistent with metastases. This is ***** at L5 level. Abnormal replacement of the marrow signal with tumor 
 enhancement along the sacral foramina and sacral canal. T12-L1: Areas mild epidural tumor at T12 compressing the thecal sac ventrally. L1-L2: Mild facet hypertrophy and mild central stenosis. L2-L3: Mild dural thickening and facet hypertrophy. L3-L4: Is asymmetrical epidural fat compressing the thecal sac with moderate stenosis. It is mild dural enhancement. There is mild tumor enhancement posterior to the psoas muscle on the right side at L4. Measures approximately 12 mm. L4-L5: Disc bulge and right sided small disc herniation resulting in right lateral recess and neural foraminal stenosis. Mild dural contrast enhancement. L5-S1: There is no central skull tumor. There is epidural thickening. This is extending from S1 segment.  02/10/17 MRI Thoracic spine w/ and w/o contrast: Thoracic metastases throughout the spine. Minimal compression of T6. There is spinal CORD compression due to epidural tumor and thickening from approximately T5-T9. There is separate mild epidural tumor and thecal sac and cord deformity at T12. The epidural enhancement is contiguous throughout the thoracic spine.  02/10/17 MRI Cervical spine w/ and w/o contrast: Heterogeneous marrow signal throughout the cervical spine consistent with metastatic replacement. No epidural tumor. No intraspinal meningeal contrast enhancement. C5-C6: Mild bulge with mild central stenosis.  02/10/17 Bone scan: Multiple focal areas of increased activity are visualized in the skull, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, multiple ribs bilaterally sternum, pelvis, proximal humeri, hips and femurs. Findings correlates with lesions seen on MRI and are consistent with widespread metastatic involvement.Of incidental note, there is no evidence of mass abnormality of the kidneys or obstructive uropathy.   02/10/17 MRI Brain: Small dural based metastases are present along the posterior interhemispheric falx and right parietal convexity. These measure approximately 1 cm or less. 
 There is no edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Ureteral based metastases are present along the posterior interhemispheric falx and parasagittal convexity bilaterally. There is no edema in the adjacent brain parenchyma. Additionally, small punctate foci of contrast enhancement are noted in the right cerebellar hemisphere inferiorly and posteriorly. It is not clear whether these are small parenchymal metastases or meningeal tumor. There is an approximately 15 mm  metastases in the upper clivus (skull).   02/10/17: BRCA1/2 negative.  02/11/17 CT A/P w/ contrast: Right breast skin thickening is partially imaged. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis. Right lower lobe posterior medial soft tissue thickening along the pleural surface. Few small right cardiophrenic angle lymph nodes are more numerous than normally seen. Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are predominantly under 1 cm. Extensive bony lytic destructive appearance to the left inferior pubic ramus with subacute/healing fractures suggested. Old right inferior pubic ramus fracture is also seen as well as lytic appearance of the left greater than right acetabulum. Small nondisplaced fracture of the left sacral ala likely pathologic with diffuse osseous metastatic involvement of the sacrum and iliac bones as well as throughout the lumbar vertebral bodies and in multiple ribs. Several healing left and right rib fractures are seen also likely pathologic. Mild degenerative disc disease L4-5.Several endplate compression fracture deformities, for example, inferior endplate compression of T12. Large lytic lesion destroys and replaces much of T10.  02/11/17 bilateral diagnostic mammogram and limited right breast US: The breast tissue is fatty with scattered fibroglandular elements. In the right breast at 12 o'clock middle third, there is a large spiculated mass containing numerous suspicious calcifications.There is diffuse overlying skin thickening as well. No suspicious findings 
 are seen in the left breast on mammography. High-resolution ultrasound of the right breast: At 12 o'clock, 2 cm from the nipple, there is a hypoechoic heterogeneous irregularly shaped mass measuring at least 10 x 5 x 7 cm corresponding to mammographic findings and palpable mass. In the right axilla, there is a 25 mm lymph node with thickened cortex that is suspicious for additional metastases.  02/14/17 CT-guided biopsy of the posterior superior left iliac bone: +metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast origin, ER+(76%)/PR+(33%)/*****+ (IHC 3+, no FISH done)  02/14/17 *****-guided biopsy of R breast mass: +IDC, moderately differentiated, ER+(97%)/PR+(79%)/*****+ (IHC 3+/FISH 15.April 10=5.4)  02/18/17: EF 76%  02/18/17 CT A/P due to hypotension and lower extremity weakness: stable compared to 02/11/17 but new left gluteus medius intermuscular hematoma.  02/18/17: new anemia of unclear etiology other than new hematoma (site of bone biopsy)  *****/*****/*****- *****/*****/***** complete 10 fractions (30 Gy) to T spine  02/23/17: start herceptin and ***** (no chemo given due to anemia), start letrozole  03/14/17: second dose herceptin and *****  03/18/17: discharged to ***** *****, *****, ***** for rehab  04/20/17: Consult Dr. ***** (UCSF), only on letrozole at this point, no h/p since *****  05/04/17: start taxotere 75mg/m2 and resume herceptin and *****  *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: admitted locally with severe sepsis, neutropenic fever, n/v  *****/*****: second dose taxotere 75mg/m2, herceptin and *****  *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: admitted locally anemia, mucositis, neutropenic fever, n/v  06/15/17: start taxol 80mg/m2 and continue herceptin and *****  *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: admitted locally with severe sepsis, neutropenic fever, n/v  07/02/17 CT Chest w/ contrast (nothing available for comparison): Previously seen mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy not mentioned.

We discussed that DCIS is a surgical disease. The primary treatment is definitive surgery which she has had. I encouraged to meet with radiation oncology to discuss adjuvant radiation and its benefit in reducing local/regional recurrence. I explained that DCIS can return 50% of the time as another insitu disease and 50% of the time as invasive disease, but technically it should not result in distant recurrence due to lack of invasion. We discussed the role of systemic therapy with tamoxifen. We reviewed the ***** B-24 study that did show a statistically significant reduction in recurrence risk with 5 years of *****, albeit the benefit was small and the side effects are not insignificant. In particular the reduction in invasive disease was 3% with tamoxifen, the remaining benefit in non-invasive disease.  No difference in distant recurrence or survival. We discussed the potential side effects including but not limited to hot flashes, vaginal discharge, headache/migraines, vaginal dryness, mood instability, sexual dysfunction, ovarian cysts, increase in fibroids, impact on uterus including ***** and abnormal vaginal bleeding, as well as small increase risk of endometrial cancer (0.5%) and thrombosis (1-2%). We discussed that she is unable to get pregnant on tamoxifen.     The patient will think about the risk/benefit. I reassured her that her prognosis is excellent. We discussed other lifestyle factors to consider including exercise, healthy BMI <30, reducing etoh.       1. The patient concerns were discussed in detail. Patient verbalizes understanding of these issues and agrees with the plan.   2. Reviewed treatment options, treatment side effects in detail.   3. 
 I reviewed the patient's medical information and medical history.   4. I have reviewed the past medical, family, and social history sections including the medications and allergies listed in the above medical record.   5. Total face to face time: 60 min Total counseling time: 50 min

The first clinic she went to gave her gemcitabine alone.    Feels she can move better, but she still has discomfort in her back.  Not pain but more stiffness.    Labs from February 24 look okay    ***** discontinue our medications and she can have a scan when she would like to get the scan.

Assessment and Recommendations:  54 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of a Stage I (*****) *****+/*****- IDC of the right breast, who will benefit from adjuvant radiation and an adjuvant aromatase inhibitor x 5 years.    I discussed with the patient in great detail the natural history and treatment of Stage I HR+/*****- breast cancer.  We reviewed her imaging and pathology reports.  She did not have a *****; it is not clear to me, but 
 it is possible that Dr. ***** performed lumpectomy alone because she was thought to have a tubular carcinoma which carries a lower risk?  It is not clear to me what the value of a lymph node biopsy would be at this point, but I will reach out to Dr. ***** to clarify.  Additionally, I noted that it was strange how her biomarkers (on her pathology report) were reported >50% for ER and PR - generally the degree of positivity would be more exact.  I will see if there is a way to speak with her pathologist.  .     I explained that there is a small, but serious risk of distant, metastatic recurrence even after optimal local control, which can be reduced with the addition of anti-estrogen therapy that is given to eradicate micrometastatic deposits of tumor. I explained that the standard, first-line recommendation for adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy in a post-menopausal patient with *****+/*****- breast cancer is an aromatase inhibitor (*****), which blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen, reducing the total body estrogen supply. I discussed the typical side-effects, including hot flashes, arthralgias, vaginal dryness, and bone density loss. I recommend that she take an ***** for at least 5 years.  I stated that she would start this after radiation.    She will need a DEXA to assess her current bone health. We discussed ways to improve her bone health, such as weight bearing exercise. She will also take calcium and vitamin D. We also discussed the importance of aerobic activity (150 minutes a week), which she does appear to currently achieve through daily walking.    Finally, she has not had a breast MRI.  She has extremely dense breast tissue.  We should have a conversation with her breast surgeon about surveillance breast MRI moving forward.    Recommendations in *****:  - proceed with radiation oncology evaluation  - plan to treat with aromatase inhibitor; would check estradiol level  - obtain DEXA  - will speak with Dr. 
 ***** about absence of *****  - will see if I can speak with pathologist about ER and PR assessments from her biopsy   - given her father's history of colon cancer and her breast cancer history, would refer for genetic testing  - consider surveillance breast MRI in c/o extreme breast density     I spent a total of 80 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.

She has completed the surgical management of her left breast cancer. I estimate that without further systemic therapy she has an approximately 10-15% chance of recurrence. This risk can be reduced with adjuvant endocrine therapy. ***** will benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy for a duration of at least 5 years. Both tamoxifen and AIs are effective with AIs showing superior efficacy in randomized trials (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****). Side effects of tamoxifen were discussed including potential for hot flashes, mood effects, increased incidence of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. AIs are restricted to the post-menopausal state and their side effects were discussed including *****, myalgias, and potential acceleration of bone loss. *****'s menopausal status is difficult to know. We will check hormone levels and make a recommendation for tamoxifen or ***** based on her menopausal status.     ***** requires breast radiotherapy to complete her breast conservation management. She is scheduled to see ***** tomorrow.     *****'s family history raises some suspicion of an inherited susceptibility syndrome. ***** refer to genetics for further evaluation and testing. I will try to ***** this, as a positive test may lead her to exercise the option of prophylactic mastectomy, and thus radiotherapy will have to be postponed until she has test results.    In summary the plan is:  - check labs including hormones  - baseline DXA scan  - 
 ***** consult tomorrow  - referral to genetics  - referral to nutritionist at her request  - F/U visit after RT to start endocrine therapy based on serologic determination of menopausal status

There was a 12mm asymmetry in the left UOQ, right breast negative.    In September 2017, she had a left diagnostic mammogram and left breast ultrasound, both showed a solid mass measuring 8mm in the left UOQ at 1:00 3CFN.    In October 2017, she had a left ultrasound guided core needle biopsy. A ribbon clip was placed. Pathology showed an atypical papillary lesion, suspicious for intracystic papillary carcinoma, possibly with an invasive component. The pathologist recommended surgical excision.    The patient has noticed ***** breast masses, nipple discharge, nipple inversion, or skin changes on self breast exam.    Before October 2017, the patient had no prior breast biopsies or surgeries. Her half-sister developed breast cancer at 45yo. She has no family history of ovarian cancer. Menarche was at 17. Menopause was at an unknown age. She has not taken HRT. She has had 1child at 25yo.

Comment: The specimen demonstrates an atypical papillary lesion with  hyperplasia and partial cribriform architecture.    Immunohistochemical study results are as follows: ***** shows marked loss  of accompanying myoepithelial cells (only few scattered myoepithelial  cells are seen within and surrounding the papillary lesion); papillary  lesion is positive for ER (100%; strong staining intensity), PR (95%;  strong staining intensity) and negative for *****/***** over-expression  (score of 1+); ki-67 shows a proliferative index of <10% positivity.    Overall, the findings are suspicious for a low-grade intracystic  papillary carcinoma; possible invasive component cannot be ruled out.  Surgical excision of the entire lesion is recommended for complete  pathologic evaluation.      Pt is here with husband for med onc consultation. She notes occ discomfort at surg site.

Standard fixation in ***** ***** is 6-48 hours for all  samples. Fixation time is unknown for samples processed in other  laboratories. A histologic section from the selected tumor block was  reviewed by a pathologist to evaluate tumor and normal tissue  morphology, and an adjacent paraffin section was used for FISH analysis.  That section was ***** with fluorescent probes from the *****  ***** (TM) ***** DNA Probe *****, which includes probes for centromere  17 (*****) and *****. The tumor slide was denatured and subsequently  allowed to hybridize with the ***** (TM) probes. Following  hybridization, the unbound probe was removed by a series of washes, and  the nuclei ***** with DAPI (4, 6 diamidino-2-phenylindole).   Enumeration of ***** and ***** signals was conducted by manual  microscopic examination of cell nuclei using a fluorescence microscope  equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filters. A control  slide with both

Educational Note:  According to CAP/***** guidelines, fixed specimens should be fixed in 10%  neutral-buffered formalin for 6-72 hours; specimens fixed in other  solutions or for durations outside this range may perform differently in  this assay. This test utilizes a laboratory modification of the  procedure for the ***** ***** (TM) ***** DNA Probe *****, which is  FDA-approved for the detection of the Her-2/neu ***** via fluorescence in  situ hybridization (FISH). Modifications were validated by the UCSF  Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory to confirm performance  characteristics, in compliance with current guidelines for clinical  implementation.

 early stage *****+/*****- IDC of the left breast diagnosed in 2009 s/p bilateral mastectomies and 5 years of Tamoxifen, now with metastatic recurrence with disease in the bone and lymph nodes.     We had an extensive discussion regarding her diagnosis and potential treatment options.     Given her cancer is HR+ and *****- we discussed that her treatment will include hormonal therapy. We discussed use of CDK February 26 inhibitors in combination with ***** for first line treatment. We reviewed the data from the ***** ***** which demonstrated ***** postmenopausal women with ER-positive, *****-negative breast cancer who were randomized to receive letrozole plus palbociclib had a median PFS of 24.8 months (compared with 14.5 months in the placebo). The most common adverse events were neutropenia, anemia, and fatigue. We also reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with aromatase inhibitors including but not limited to arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss/fractures, and discussed strategies to mitigate these side effects. She has consented to treatment and thus letrozole has been sent to ***** *****. Palbociclib has been sent to the ***** ***** *****. We discussed potential palbociclib side effects including but not limited to myelosuppression in particular neutropenia requiring count checks every 4 weeks before the start of the next cycle, as well as mucositis, fatigue, n/v, hair thinning, pneumonitis.      Since she has extensive bony mets and new pain, we recommend obtaining new scans and ordered MRI of total spine and CAP CT. We will request her outside PET/CT for comparison. We also discussed that in patients with breast cancer with bone metastases, use of bone modifying agents reduce the risk of skeletal related events. Thus, we recommend initiation of denosumab.We recommend that she have dental clearance prior to its initiation and reviewed potential AEs 
 associated with this including *****. We also referred to radiation oncology for consult however her rib and back pain seem migratory and it is not clear if she has a focal site of pain.      We will request her outside pathology and request foundation one testing on this. If there are not enough cells, will send for ***** 360 testing.       Plan  - MRI Total Spine  - CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis  - Rad Onc referral  - Xgeva - needs dental evaluation first   - Obtain outside PET/CT  - Obtain outside path and send for foundation one, if this is not possible, would send for ***** 360  - Start Letrozole, Rx given  - Rx for Palbociclib. OK to start.  She will need monthly blood work on Palbociclib   - Repeat imaging after 3 months on treatment  -labs including tumor markers      RTC in ~ 1 month      Patient seen and discussed with breast oncology attending *****. ***** ***** *****, MD    ***** *****, MD PGY-5  Hematology/Oncology Fellow        I spent a total of 75 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures.

HPI  This postmenopausal ***** female is referred by breast surgeon Dr. ***** ***** following recent partial mastectomy for biopsy proven DCIS. She has ***** General Medicine history of care at ***** for osteopenia, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and also general health screening. Her recent mammographic screen (on 10/09/2018, compared with 05/10/2016 and earlier screens) identified an increase in suspicious, segmental, heterogeneously dense microcalcifications in her right upper outer breast; and imaged guided biopsy of these calcifications showed intermediate grade DCIS, ER+ (98%) PR+ (90%).  Her right breast 11/08/2018 stereotactic core biopsy showed intermediate grade DCIS associated with calcifications; and her ***** localized right upper quadrant partial mastectomy on 12/28/2017 showed intermediate nuclear grade DCIS, mixed solid papillary, cribiform pattern with some comedo necrosis, no invasive ductal cancer but DCIS spanning ~5.0 cm (9 contiguous slices), clear surgical margins. She has had an uncomplicated post-surgical course and was last seen by Dr. ***** on January 10 when she was referred to ***** ***** (today's visit) and also Rad Onc (scheduled for 02/01/2019) for consideration of adjuvant radiation +/- endocrine therapy to reduce her risk of right breast DCIS recurrence or progression to invasive cancer.    Medical, surgical, reproductive, family and social histories: menarche age 13, G0P0, menopause age 51, no history of hormone replacement therapy.

 2.97%. Due to her strong family history of breast cancer (two sisters in their 50s, plus multiple ***** in their 50s and ***** niece in her 40s with breast cancer) she had genetic testing (Invitae) on 09/20/2016 which evaluated 52 genes all of which were negative for any pathogenic variant sequences. She's had ***** recent bone density study 10/11/2018 (compared to 07/01/2014) showing continued osteopenia for which she's been on treatment with vitamin D and calcium supplementation; her bone density study will be repeated in 2 years. Apart from colonoscopy screening several years ago, she has never had any other surgical procedure.

Assessment:       Nulliparous postmenopausal ***** female who, despite strong family history of breast cancer, negative genetic screen, and relatively low estimates of ever developing breast DCIS or breast cancer, showed progressing ~5cm area of suspicious ***** microcalcifications that, following complete resection, revealed intermediate grade ER+/PR+ DCIS spanning 5cm and including areas of comedo necrosis. I discussed with her Dr. *****'s recommendation that she be evaluated by Rad Onc and Med Onc to consider both adjuvant XRT and endocrine therapy to minimize 
 her future risk of recurrent DCIS or progression to invasive ductal cancer over next decade, given her overall excellent health and likelihood of living another 20 years. I informed her that, overall, patients with DCIS may have up to 25-30% recurrence risk which could be reduced to 15% or less if given breast XRT; and that adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex) for 5 years after XRT would further reduce her risk to 5-8% and provide lifelong chemoprotectant benefit for her uninvolved (left) breast. I emphasized that these options would not likely enhance her longevity.  I also pointed out that by the MSKCC nomogram for DCIS recurrence risk, inputting her age and all other features, her 10 year risk might be closer to 15%, but that XRT +/- endocrine therapy would provide significant risk reduction that she should consider further after her pending UCSF Rad Onc consultation. We also discussed the side effects and MSS and bone density complications of aromatase inhibitor therapy given her present diagnosis of osteopenia, and how this latter risk could be mitigated with bisphosphonate therapy.       Plan:       She is inclined toward undertaking additional adjuvant treatment(s) to minimize her risks over the next decade of recurrent DCIS or progression to invasive breast cancer. She understands and looks forward to her ***** evaluation in two weeks which requires her first decision. She will then plan to return for ***** follow-up visit in 3-4 months allowing time to complete right breast XRT if that option is recommended and accepted.

Left breast, deep margin, excision: Benign skeletal muscle and  fibroadipose tissue.  D. Left breast, anterior margin over DCIS, excision: Benign  fibroadipose tissue.     Assessment and Plan:  ***** ***** ***** is a 63 y.o. female with ***** +/ ***** negative invasive carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. We reviewed her work-up to date and her pathology result. I explained that her cancer is low risk and I do not recommend adjuvant chemotherapy. Because her breast cancer is strongly estrogen receptor positive, we discussed beginning an endocrine based therapy, specifically letrozole. She understands that she will receive at least five years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.     In terms of hormonal therapy, I explained that aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have improved outcomes in terms of DFS as compared to tamoxifen. I also discussed the data from ***** and ***** which demonstrated modest benefit of extending hormonal therapy beyond 5 years. I explained that the decision to continue the aromatase inhibitor beyond 5 years should be an individualized decision based on the patient's risk and tolerance of hormonal therapy.    I reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with an 
 aromatase inhibitors including arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss. I explained that the joint pains are often the most difficult side effect to manage, and not infrequently, patients will switch to another aromatase inhibitor, and if not able to tolerate, we will consider switching to a different ***** or tamoxifen.    I have ordered a base line DEXA. We briefly discussed the role of bone targeted therapies. We will have a more in depth discussion of these therapies once she is further along in treatment. In the interim, I encouraged her to maintain a calcium rich diet, take in an adequate amount of Vitamin D (typically at least *****-***** ***** per day in a post-menopausal patient without much sun exposure) and engage in weight bearing exercise.  I  encouraged exercise to meet the goal of 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week since this has been associated with improvement in breast cancer specific and overall survival among breast cancer patients.      F/U: 3 months     Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects, clinical trials, and follow up plan were reviewed  in detail.

Currently on off week due to start 04/12/2011. Had constipation until last 4 days of cycle on xeloda. Denies hand and foot syndrome. Up and able to do more in the day. ***** on knitting project. In bed now 50% of the time. Denies going outside due to ***** hard to get up and down without assistance due to weakness. Denies dizziness or headache. Occasionally 1-2 times a month taking pain medication. Nausea and vomiting not a problem this cycle.Pain is happening in      Patient Active Problem List   Diagnoses Date Noted    Breast cancer metastasized to multiple sites 01/28/2011     Priority: High     December 2006 patient had a mammogram and ultrasound of the right breast to evaluate a palpable mass.  In January 2007 patient underwent fine-needle aspiration that revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.  03/29/2007 the patient underwent a right lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy revealing a 3.5 cm invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive, and HER-2/neu. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive and therefore the patient underwent a full axillary lymph node dissection on 04/12/2007 revealing April 07 lymph nodes positive.  The patient received 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 4 cycles of Taxotere.  January 2008 the patient completed radiation to the right breast.  March 2008 the patient started adjuvant tamoxifen.  However she had a CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis that revealed an abnormality in the left breast.  08/23/2008 the patient underwent an MRI of bilateral breasts revealing a 12 mm mass in the lower inner quadrant of the left breast.  10/11/2008 the patient underwent left breast mammogram revealing a 
 suspicious mass in the left breast.  10/30/2008 the patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration that revealed an invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  12/18/2008 the patient underwent a left breast lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 1.5 cm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2 negative by immunohistochemistry.  One out of the 3 sentinel lymph nodes was positive.  In December 2008 the patient had a completion axillary lymph node dissection and only 2 lymph nodes were seen both negative for cancer.  In January 2009, the patient initiated chemotherapy with Cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-*****.  She also started Lupron at this time.  The patient underwent genetic testing and was negative for BRCA1 and 2.  08/27/2009 the patient underwent a CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis revealing enhancing tissue in the right anterior breast, a sclerotic focus in the left sacral ala, and a new sclerotic focus in the right anterior superior acetabulum. A bone scan on 09/04/2009 revealed no uptake to suggest osseous metastasis.  09/12/2009 the patient initiated postoperative radiation to the left breast, supraclavicular, and axillary regions receiving 1800 cGY to these regions.  09/20/2009, the patient underwent a core biopsy of a mass in the 12:00 position of the right breast which revealed a grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma.  11/08/2009, the patient underwent a PET CT scan at ***** revealing skin thickening in the right breast, a 1.1 cm area of soft tissue enhancement in the right breast, no axillary or internal mammary adenopathy, and no clear evidence of distant metastatic disease.  12/14/2009 the patient underwent bilateral mastectomies, bilateral ***** flap reconstruction, and a left completion axillary 
 dissection. Pathology from the left breast revealed no cancer, and 0/8 axillary lymph nodes contained metastatic cancer.  However in the right breast mastectomy specimen, there was was 2 cm of grade 1 invasive ductal cancer.  0 of 6 lymph nodes removed contained cancer on the right side.  The invasive cancer was again estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  November 2009 the patient initiated letrozole.  October 2010 the patient began to experience some lightheadedness when standing.  She then developed more severe headaches.  Finally she noted a lump in the left side of her neck.  12/06/2010 the patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration of a left supraclavicular lymph node which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma which was very weakly estrogen receptor positive with only 1-5% of the cells staining, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  12/11/2010 the patient underwent a PET CT scan which revealed a new right frontal dural based metastasis with SUV of 28.2 with surrounding vasogenic edema and mass effect.  The scan also revealed multiple hypermetabolic left cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  There was hypermetabolism along the right parasternal chest wall consistent with recurrent disease possibly invading the sternum.  There was also bilateral subpectoral lymphadenopathy with maximum SUV of 11.4 on the left and 4.1 on the right.  There was an area of focal hypermetabolism in the hepatic segment ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** a maximum SUV of 7.0 suspicious for early hepatic metastasis.  There was multifocal osseous metastatic disease identified within the C2, L2 vertebral bodies as well as in the sacrum.  12/11/2010 the patient underwent an MRI of the brain which revealed a 4 cm left inferior frontal extra-axial mass new since 11/08/2009.  Patient met with radiation oncology as 
 well as neurosurgery to discuss treatment options.  12/30/2010 the patient underwent resection of the frontal brain metastasis.  Pathology confirmed that it was consistent with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of breast primary, and was estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu negative.  02/10/2011 - Whole brain RT: 30 gray in 10 fractions  03/01/2011 - Started Xeloda 4000mg (actually took 2000mg) daily 14 days on 7 days off  03/12/2011 - PET/CT (during cycle 1 Xeloda) with PD including liver, bones, LNs, breast.

Musculoskeletal: Multiple osseous lesions involving the   thoracolumbar and sternum are not changed in size since prior   study and do not demonstrate hypermetabolic activity, consistent   with treated metastases. Left iliac wing sclerotic lesion is   unchanged in size and metabolic activity with an SUV of 3.1.   Persistent FDG uptake within left L1 pedicle (SUV 6) and anterior   vertebral body (SUV 9) is not significantly changed since prior.

I discussed with the patient the natural history and treatment of Stage ***** *****+/*****- breast cancer.  We reviewed her pathology and imaging reports.  I explained that there is a small, but serious risk of distant, metastatic recurrence even after optimal local control, which can be reduced with the addition of anti-estrogen therapy that is given to eradicate micrometastatic deposits of tumor. I explained that the standard, first-line recommendation for adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy in a post-menopausal patient with *****+/*****- breast cancer is an aromatase inhibitor (*****), which blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen, reducing the total body estrogen supply. I discussed the typical side-effects, including hot flashes, arthralgias, vaginal dryness, and bone density loss. I recommend that she take an ***** for at least 5 years.     She will need a DEXA at this time to assess her current bone health. We discussed ways to improve her bone health, such as weight bearing exercise. She will also take calcium and 
 vitamin D. We also discussed the importance of aerobic activity (150 minutes a week).    I expect that she will proceed with radiation.  We will plan on meeting again once her radiation course is complete to review DEXA and plan her ***** start.  She stated clear understanding and was in agreement with this plan.       Recommendations in *****:  - proceed with radiation oncology consultation; ***** ***** she will have radiation  - obtain DEXA   - calcium/vitamin D  - aim to resume her daily aerobic activities    RTC after radiation course is completed    I spent a total of 90 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.

Imaging results reviewed and discussed with patient:         03/17/2019 BREAST MRI  MRI Findings:  Overall breast composition: The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue. The background parenchymal enhancement is mild.    RIGHT Breast:  1) There is a irregularly shaped mass with spiculated margins and heterogeneous internal enhancement in the right breast, upper OUTER quadrant measuring 12 x 11 x 14 mm (best seen on axial T1 post-contrast image 99/***** and ***** image *****/*****). This mass demonstrates marked T2 hyperintensity. Kinetic curve assessment demonstrates predominately fast initial and delayed washout enhancement pattern.    2) Additional satellite masses are seen, for example within the upper INNER quadrant measuring 4 x 7 x 7 mm mass, best seen on axial T1 post-contrast image 118/*****, ***** image *****/*****). This mass is in close approximation to the skin surface, and is likely the sampled lesion performed out outside institution in *****. Kinetic curve assessment demonstrates predominately fast initial and delayed washout enhancement pattern.    3) Additional ***** mass is seen inferior to 
 the dominant upper OUTER mass, measuring 7 x 6 x 6 mm (best seen on axial T1 post contrast image 141/*****, ***** image *****/*****). Kinetic curve assessment demonstrates predominately fast initial and delayed washout enhancement pattern.    4)  Stippled non-mass ***** is seen surrounding the mass and ***** masses with overall extent of non-mass enhancement and masses measuring approximately 5 cm as measured on post-contrast MIPs.    LEFT Breast:  No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified.    OTHER:  The axillae and visualized chest are unremarkable.    IMPRESSION:   Right breast: Suspicious (BI-RADS 4).  Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1).    Recommendations:  ***** mass in the upper OUTER quadrant of the right breast with ***** masses and surrounding NME ***** a majority of the upper outer quadrant extending into the upper INNER quadrant of the right breast at site of known skin -associated cancer. Recommend continued surgical and oncologic management of patient's known right breast IDC. As the skin-associated mass within the upper inner quadrant was previously sampled at the outside institution, recommend second look ultrasound and possible biopsy of the dominant mass within the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.    Recommend routine breast MRI screening in 1 year for the left breast if cumulative lifetime risk >= 20%.

Her tumor was found to have a ***** Low Risk profile.    Today we discussed her diagnosis of early stage breast cancer and the role of 
 adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. She understands that she will need to undergo re-excision for the margin positive for non-invasive cancer and she also understands the role of post-lumpectomy radiation. She has met with Dr. ***** in ***** *****.    *****. ***** reviewed the meaning of the ***** result and described the data for use of ***** as both a prognostic and predictive tool. We explained the published results form the ***** trial which demonstrated that patients who have clinical higher risk cancers based on traditional measures including tumor size, grade and lymph node status, but whose tumors have a ***** Low Risk profile have an excellent prognosis at 5 years even in the absence of chemotherapy, and chemotherapy offers very little benefit for these patient. Given this is *****'s situation, Dr. ***** does not recommend chemotherapy.    In terms of hormonal therapy, we explained that aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have improved outcomes in terms of DFS as compared to tamoxifen. The decision regarding continuing hormone therapy for 5 versus 10 years will be considered later and will largely depend on *****'s tolerance of hormonal therapy.    We reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with an aromatase inhibitors including arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss. We explained that the joint pains are often the most difficult side effect to manage, and not infrequently, patients will switch to another aromatase inhibitor, and if not able to tolerate, we will consider switching to tamoxifen.     In regards to efficacy, there are three AIs and all are equivalent,  although some patients tolerate one better than another. Therefore, we will recommend she start letrozole 2.5mg PO daily.    We discussed that while on hormone therapy, she should undergo assessment for bone health, specifically a bone density scan. 
 Her last bone density scan was >10 years ago. This repeat scan can happen In September when she returns for surgery. If her scan ***** any osteopenia, we will discuss starting a bisphosphonate (favoring PO). She should also take  vitamin D and calcium in the meantime. She already incorporates 20-30 minutes of moderate to high intensity exercise daily.     Lastly, we also discussed management of vaginal atrophy as a side effect of hormone therapy, including the use of nonhormonal vaginal moisturizers including ***** (which she currently uses). We will continue to discuss management of the above upon her return in September.    Due to her work schedule abroad, she is deciding how to best sequence her upcoming treatment. She has discussed with Dr. ***** that ideally she will allow 3 months to allow the lumpectomy cavity to heal, and during this time, she can initiate hormonal therapy. This ***** well with her travel plans, and she was already planning on taking home leave in late August/early September for her daughter's college graduation. Therefore, she will start letrozole now and likely return in September for her surgery. She may pursue RT closer to home in *****, and will also likely establish her long-term oncology follow up closer to home (New ***** or *****) as well.    In regards to her radiation therapy plan, she is at risk for local recurrence in her right breast for which ***** is recommending additional radiation. Given her surgical pathology with only micrometastatic disease in her sentinel lymph node, they are not recommending adjuvant radiation to her regional lymph nodes.    Plan:    1. Start letrozole 2.5mg PO daily now (prescription sent)  2. Calcium supplementation with  1200mg/day combination of diet and supplement. ***** recommend vit D supplement pending *****-***** ***** ***** ***** today  3. Bone density scan can be completed when she returns from *****  4. ental eval and clearance if considering 
 bisphosphonate pending bone scan result  5. Surgical planning per Dr. *****, tentatively scheduled for September 2019  6. RT planning per *****, likely pursued locally in *****    2. Urogenital atrophy prevention  - Continue use of vaginal moisturizer. (ie *****). Can also try coconut oil and/or *****, and will discuss vaginal estrogens at future visit.      Patient seen and examined with Dr ***** whose attestation will follow    Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects, clinical trials, and follow up plan were reviewed  in detail.  Total face to face time: 60 minutes  Total counseling time: 40 minutes

FINDINGS:    Brain: Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. No mass effect. While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated.    Neck: No hypermetabolic neck masses or lymphadenopathy.    Chest: Large, enhancing, hypermetabolic right breast mass measuring approximately 9.0 x 3.8 cm in axial dimensions (series 2, image 127) with maximum SUV 7.8. At least 2 mildly hypermetabolic right 
 axillary lymph nodes measuring 6 mm and 7 mm (series 2, image 107) with maximum SUV 1.8. Additionally, there is an enhancing, hypermetabolic 7 mm ***** (in the subcutaneous fat of the right chest wall) lymph node (series 2, image 95) with maximum SUV 2.9.    Multiple coronary artery calcifications. Tiny calcified pulmonary nodules, likely sequela of prior granulomatous disease.    Abdomen/Pelvis: Nonspecific 6 mm hypodensity in hepatic segment 3 (series 2, image 172), too small to characterize but likely benign; attention on follow-up. Nonspecific 8 mm splenic hypodensity (series 2, image 164) but likely benign; attention on follow-up. No hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy.    Musculoskeletal: FDG uptake at the level of the coccyx (maximum SUV 5.0). Given the location, highly likely to be inflammatory or posttraumatic. No definite metastatic lesions.    IMPRESSION:     1. Large, enhancing hypermetabolic right breast mass measuring approximately 9.0 cm in maximal dimension, suggesting disease recurrence. Please see MR breast 12/11/2016 for further details.    2. Enhancing hypermetabolic right axillary and right subcutaneous lymph nodes, suggesting nodal involvement.    3. FDG uptake at the level of the coccyx is favored to be inflammatory or posttraumatic. Recommend correlation and attention on follow-up.    This study was reviewed by attendings Dr. ***** ***** from ***** ***** and Dr. ***** *****. ***** of Nuclear Medicine.    END OF IMPRESSION    Assessment and Recommendations:  64 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a clinical stage II-III *****-/*****+ IDC of the right breast who should proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    We reviewed the available imaging and pathology reports.  We discussed her original DCIS diagnosis from 2007 as well as a second biopsy in 2013 that was concerning for microinvasive disease; she did not undergo conventional therapy at the time of her original diagnoses.  I 
 explained to her that she now had clear evidence of invasive breast cancer, but noted that her PET/CT demonstrated no evidence of metastases and therefore she can now be treated with curative intent.  I discussed with ***** and her husband in great detail the natural history and treatment of early stage *****-/*****+ IDC.  I explained that were she to forego the recommended therapy, I am very concerned that she would develop metastatic disease in the short term, even in the context of her 10 year history of DCIS.    We discussed the multimodality approach to breast cancer treatment. The patient understands that her treatment recommendations will include chemotherapy, biological therapies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), surgery, and radiation. We discussed the advantages of offering chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in order to increase the chances of breast conserving surgery, while concurrently allowing us to assess the response to treatment.  I explained that in the context of her high-risk node-negative, ***** positive disease we would typically recommend that she receive either 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel plus trastuzumab/pertuzumab (THP) followed by 4 cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) every 2 weeks or 6 cycles of every 3 week docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab (TCHP).  I also explained that either regimen would be followed by every 3 week trastuzumab for a total of one year of biological therapy.     We reviewed the potential side effects of both regimens.  Given her extensive disease even in the absence of nodal involvement, I recommend that she proceed with an anthracycline-containing regimen, unless she is found to have substantial cardiac dysfunction on TTE.  I specifically discussed with ***** the typical and less common side-effects associated with THP/AC, such as: fatigue, nausea, myelosuppression, nail changes, alopecia, diarrhea, and constipation. I stated that 
 with regards to trastuzumab, she is at risk of a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, which can result in asymptomatic or symptomatic heart failure with dyspnea and chest pain.  I stated that pertuzumab is associated with diarrhea and rash.  We additionally discussed the rare adverse events associated with THP/AC, both secondary leukemia and cardiomyopathy.      After an extensive discussion, the patient completely understands the rationale for neoadjuvant treatment and will spend the weekend considering where she wants to proceed with her therapy.  I explained to her that I would recommend she start her treatment within 2 to 3 weeks.  She would need a TTE, Mediport placement, and if treated here at *****, a chemotherapy teaching session.    The patient will contact me after the weekend and let me know whether she plans to proceed with treatment here at ***** or elsewhere, closer to home.    I spent a total of 120 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 115 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, the risks and benefits of surgery, symptoms and therapeutic options.

 PET/CT performed on 12/05/2016. PET/CT and CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed on 10/30/2017 could not be retrieved for direct comparison at the time   of dictation.     HISTORY: 64-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer. Restaging.     TECHNIQUE:     PET/CT: Overnight fast. F-18 FDG, 14.8 mCi right antecubital. Appropriate delay. Skull base to mid thighs PET-CT. Images (multiplanar - axial/coronal/sagittal) at computer display, with and without attenuation correction, static and cinematic,   qualitative and quantitative. Low-dose CT for PET attenuation correction yields limited anatomic images. Fusion imaging. Please note that ***** ***** component of this PET-CT exam was performed, as standard, with shallow breathing (to match PET). Interval   post injection was 60 minutes. Blood glucose was 109 mg/dL.      *****: 4.90 mGy and DLP: 440 mGy-cm.     CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed following the intravenous administration of 100 mL of Omnipaque 300. 0 mL discarded.     *****: 9.00 mGy and DLP: 265 mGy-cm.     *****: 6.07 mGy and DLP: 282 mGy-cm.     CT dose reduction technique utilized with one of more of the following: Automated exposure control and/***** of the mA and/or kV according to patient size and/or use of iterative reconstruction technique.     FINDINGS:     SKELETAL: Again noted are numerous sclerotic and mixed lytic sclerotic osseous metastases throughout the skeleton, increasing in ***** uptake and number when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021, interpreted as osseous disease progression. For   example, a peripherally sclerotic osseous metastasis in the left lesser trochanter of the femur now measures a maximal SUV of 3.0, previously measuring a maximal SUV of 1.7, without overlying cortical disruption nor superimposed pathological fracture at this time. A mixed lytic sclerotic osseous metastasis in the anterior aspect of the L4 vertebral body now 
 measures a maximal SUV of 5.2, previously measuring a maximal SUV of 3.4. A sclerotic osseous metastasis in the right aspect of the T7 vertebral body now measures a maximal SUV of 3.1, previously measuring a maximal SUV of 2.7. An FDG avid faintly sclerotic osseous metastasis in the left scapula measures a maximal SUV of 2.6 (image 65), new when compared to prior.     No vertebral body compression fractures. Degenerative changes are noted in the spine, again noting underlying degenerative disc disease is noted at L5-S1 with intervertebral disc space narrowing and degenerative endplate changes.     HEAD/NECK: No suspicious FDG avid neck masses nor cervical lymphadenopathy.     There is a focal region of apparent increased FDG uptake in the visualized portion of the right frontal lobe (image 1), incompletely characterized on this study. Chronic deformity of the right lamina ***** is noted. A mucous retention cyst is noted   in the left maxillary sinus. The remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.     CHEST: There is no suspicious focus of increased FDG uptake in the chest. There is no FDG avid lymphadenopathy within the chest. No enlarging lymph nodes are identified in the chest.     The central airways are patent. No FDG avid pulmonary nodules or masses. Underlying emphysematous changes. No pleural effusions.     There is a right-sided chest port with the tip terminating in the distal SVC. The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber. The heart size is within normal limits. No pericardial effusions. Small hiatal hernia.     ABDOMEN/PELVIS: Numerous FDG avid hepatic metastases have increased in size and FDG uptake when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021. For example, a hepatic metastasis in the left hepatic lobe now measures 2.5 x 2.0 cm with a maximal SUV of 6.7   (image 141), previously measuring 1.9 x 1.5 cm with a maximum SUV of 5.0 . A hepatic metastasis 
 adjacent to the falciform ligament measures approximately 3.5 x 2.1 cm with a maximal SUV of 6.2 (image 135), previously measuring 2.9 x 1.9 cm with a   maximal SUV of 4.5. An FDG avid hepatic metastasis in the central aspect of the liver measures 1.9 x 1.8 cm with a maximal SUV of 5.8 (image 125), previously measuring 1.0 x 0.9 cm with a maximal SUV of 3.5.     The hepatic veins, portal veins, splenic vein, and SMV are patent. The gallbladder is grossly unremarkable. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The pancreas is unremarkable. The spleen is unremarkable.     No FDG avid adrenal masses.Symmetric renal enhancement. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. Urinary bladder is grossly unremarkable. The uterus is absent.     There is prominent intraluminal FDG uptake in the anorectal region measuring a maximal SUV of 5.9, previously measuring a maximal SUV of 7.3, without underlying discernible CT correlate, nonspecific. The visualized bowel is normal in caliber without   evidence of obstruction. There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum. A normal appendix is seen. Vascular calcifications are noted in a normal caliber abdominal aorta.     IMPRESSION:   IMPRESSION:     1. Progression of metastatic disease when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021. Numerous FDG avid hepatic metastases have increased in size and FDG uptake when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021.     2. Numerous FDG avid skeletal metastases throughout the skeleton have increased in ***** uptake and number when compared to prior study performed on 01/17/2021.     3. Focal region of apparent increased FDG uptake in the visualized portion of the right frontal lobe, incompletely characterized on this study, which could potentially be *****, however, further evaluation with MRI of the brain is recommended to   exclude the possibility of an intracranial metastasis.     4. Persistent prominent

The patient's blood pressure was 144 mmHg/78 mmHg during the study. The heart rate during the study was 74. Color Flow Doppler was utilized for this exam. Spectral Doppler was utilized for this exam.  1. The left ventricular volume is normal. LV function is normal. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 55 to 60%. There is no left ventricular hypertrophy. No segmental wall motion abnormalities 
 present.  2. The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal.  3. Left atrial size is normal. Right atrial size is normal.  4. There is no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  5. There is no Doppler evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction.  6. The RV systolic pressure is at least 19 mmHg based on a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to the lack of a complete ***** jet.  7. No pericardial effusion noted. The inferior vena cava is less than 21 mm in diameter and collapses with inspiration consistent with a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  8. Aortic root dimension is normal.                  Previous Comparison:  No previous study is available for comparison.       Cardiac *****:  Left Ventricle: The left ventricular volume is normal. LV function is normal. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 55 to 60%. 3 view global longitudinal strain is minus 17.9 % which is in the normal range (-17 to -22). There is no left ventricular   hypertrophy. No segmental wall motion abnormalities present.  LV Diastolic Function: There is no Doppler evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction. Doppler tissue imaging suggests normal left sided filling pressures with an E/E' of 5.  Right Ventricle: The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal. RV S' velocity is 13 cm/s.  Left Atrium:Left atrial size is normal.  Right Atrium:Right atrial size is normal.  Cardiac output: Doppler findings are consistent with a normal cardiac output.     Cardiac Valves:  Aortic Valve: The aortic valve anatomy and motion are normal. No aortic regurgitation is present.  Mitral Valve: The mitral valve anatomy and motion are normal. Trace / physiologic mitral regurgitation is present.  Tricuspid Valve: Tricuspid valve anatomy and motion are normal. There is trace tricuspid regurgitation.  Pulmonic Valve: The pulmonary valve is not well 
 seen. There is no pulmonic regurgitation.     Other:  Pulmonary Artery and Right Sided Pressures: The pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to the lack of a complete ***** jet. The RV systolic pressure is at least 19 mmHg based on a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  Aorta: Aortic root dimension is normal. The ascending aorta appears normal in size.  Pericardium: Prominent epicardial fat pad noted. No pericardial effusion noted.  IVC and Hepatic Veins: The inferior vena cava is less than 21 mm in diameter and collapses with inspiration consistent with a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.

   ***** has had an unfortunate local relapse. This is actually her second local relapse following a rapid early local relapse in 2012. She did enjoy an 8 year disease-free interval but the current local relapse ***** a high risk of future relapse and mortality from this disease.    The benefit of chemotherapy in reducing her recurrence risk and mortality was reviewed. This was the subject of the CALOR study which showed that adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of local recurrences benefits ***** with ER negative disease, but does not benefit patients with ER positive disease (***** ***** *****). I don't think ***** will benefit from chemotherapy at this point.    ***** will benefit from the resumption of hormonal therapy. Her recurrence did occur a year after stopping anastrozole against medical advice, so potentially this disease remains ***** sensitive. On the other hand, the disease is naive to tamoxifen and this may be a more effective option in this case, specially considering the possibility of *****-resistant clonal ***** mutations that may have arisen during the years of ***** therapy. Side effects of tamoxifen were discussed including the potential for thromboembolic phenomenon including DVT and PE and endometrial cancers.     ***** has had two local recurrences and will benefit from chest wall RT. She declined this previously which is unfortunate, but she accepts a referral now. ***** refer to ***** for consultation.

The patient says that prior to March 
 of 2011 she had no gastrointestinal complaints whatsoever.  She had no abdominal pain, no change in bowel habit, no nausea or vomiting.  The patient was given a course of prednisone and antibiotics for a sinus infection, and following this for her abdominal complaints started.  She says that on balance her complaints are a bit better.  She still has abdominal gas and bloating, and some irregularity of bowel habit and recurrent nausea.  However she denies any recent episodes of severe cramping abdominal pain at least for the last one to 2 months.  Despite the symptoms the patient has not lost any significant amount of weight.  She has not had any vomiting of blood or rectal bleeding.  She denies any fevers or chills.  The patient had a colonoscopy in 2010 soon before the onset of the symptoms and that was normal by her report.  She was seen by her primary physician and Dr. ***** for these complaints, and no significant abnormalities were found during their evaluation.  By her report she had routine laboratory studies including a celiac antibody profile was normal.

She felt a left breast mass in 2017.  Imaging was thought to be fibrocystic changes.      She was diagnosed in June 2020 with a large left breast cancer 6.8 cm and enlarged lymph nodes that were negative on pet and by biopsy.  The tumor was essentially a triple negative cancer: ER negative, ***** April 05+ in 15% and her 2 negative.  She saw Dr. ***** and received neoadjuvant ***** followed by 5 weeks of taxol which was stopped due to side effects. She had a repeat MRI November 2020 showed a mild response and pet in December 2020 was negative for distant disease. She is planning on bilateral skin sparing ***** with tissue expander placement with Dr. ***** and *****.  Recent right breast biopsy was negative.     She was responding to chemotherapy but now the breast cancer is palpable again.  We discussed using some other IV treatment for shrinking the tumor and she declines to do anything prior to surgery.      She reports with 
 chemotherapy she had poor night vision , could not think, premature menopause.  She has severe pain in the breast.  she wants to change to me of ongoing treatment.  She reports feeling  poor exercise tolerance.      We discussed olaparib and xeloda.  We discussed the importance of exercise to help her recover from toxicity of chemotherapy.  She feels like things are now clear. We will consider the vaccine trial after the final pathology is back.  I think it has to be a pure triple negative cancer to be screened.

Subsequent to our clinic visit, the patient underwent a second FNA of the left axillary LNs and it again showed no cancer. Because of her ATM mutation, radiation oncology has recommended that she proceed with mastectomy rather than breast conserving surgery. ***** underwent bilateral mastectomy on 04/11/18 with Dr ***** and was found to have a 3 cm grade 3 IDC in the left breast with March 09 SLN involved by micrometastasis.     1. Breast Cancer: At a previous visit, we had a a detailed discussion with ***** and her family members about the recent surgery and the findings of her pathology report. She has decided to proceed with AC-Taxol.    I explained to ***** that at ***** we tend to offer ***** Taxol for 12 weeks FOLLOWED by AC over dose dense AC-Taxol as it is better tolerated when patients start with the taxane and it will be better for her quality of life. I informed her that the efficacy of the treatment does not change regardless of the order, 
 and that one retrospective study from ***** suggests that giving the taxane first may actually improve outcomes.    We again reviewed the risks of chemotherapy and explained that she will likely have some form of educational meeting to discuss side effect management further with Dr. *****'s staff.    After completion of chemotherapy I will recommend ovarian suppression with an aromatase inhibitor and she may also be eligible for the ***** trial (with ribociclib).      2. Symptom Management:  While we do support the use of medical marijuana, I advised against smoking raw ***** because of the possibility of introducing carcinogens but she has the option of using vape pens or ***** to help manage nausea and other symptoms    I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories.

She was prescribed Lexapro previously but has not taken it.    5. BRCA1 mutation: S/p bilateral mastectomy. She will see Dr. ***** on 12/02/18 to discuss bilateral oophorectomy.     6. Pain in neck and back and limited ROM in bilateral arms: Referred to PT.     Follow up on 01/05/19       This is a shared visit for services provided by me, ***** ***** *****, MD. I performed a face-to-face encounter with the patient and the following portion of the note is my own.     I have reviewed the history and participated in the physical exam and assessment and plan as documented.    Additional A/P: ***** looks a little stronger today and has gained a few pounds. Per the NP note, ***** will undergo a BSO eventually, but depending on timing, she may not need OS if she does not recover ovarian 
 function before then. We will submit authorization for her to get Zoladex here in the event that there is a delay in her oophorectomy. We also addressed her ongoing neck pain which she now feels is related to how she is sleeping as a result of her bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction. She understands that ***** ***** head obtained at outside hospital was negative but we cannot obtain MRI with tissue expanders in place.    We have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories and spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 30 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options. Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.

I performed a face-to-face encounter with the patient and contributed to this note.     ***** is s/p bilateral mastectomies with Dr ***** on 06/23/21. We reviewed the path - she has 3.5 cm residual disease including May 27 +SLN with *****. She has +margin. We discussed the pathology in detail. She need a re-excision. I explained that she had a good response to chemotherapy based on where she started. We will d/w Dr. ***** and Dr. ***** need for addition LN surgery at time of re-excision. She will proceed to xrt after re-excision. We started her on adjuvant letrozole (she is s/p BSO) today. We reviewed side effects. ***** get DEXA. She will return in 3 months after xrt and we will start abemaciclib after xrt.

She has a history of endometriosis and recent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral *****. She completed Taxol ***** followed by ***** on 05/26/21.         INTERVAL HISTORY AND RELEVANT SYMPTOMS    Underwent right lumpectomy sentinel LN with bil mastopexy on June 25 with Dr. *****. She's having a hard time with the path report. She knows she has to go back for positive margines. Waiting to hear back about schedule.     Her left port incision is still red. Sensitive to touch but to pain. No s/sx infection. Port removed July 08.     Nails lifted and hyperpigmented but they're growing.     Numbness in fingertips which extend May 28 down to the fingers. Worse in bil index fingers.  Was on gabapentin 600 mg after her abd surgery but had a hard time coming off. Her mood was affected. Skin and hand is better. Does not feel burned anymore. 
     No N/V. Stopped omeprazole. BM normal. Eating ok.     Occasional dizziness last few days. Thinks she's hydrating well.     Body aches in her upper body is improving. Continues naproxen bid. Right hand joint pain, especially in her thumb. Saw rheumatology and didn't think it was autoimmune related. Referred to PT, but PT is only taking pts post surgery and not hand, but has agreed to see her.       Specialty Problems        Malignant Neoplasms    1. Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of right breast in female,   estrogen receptor positive (CMS code)     Overview      10/11/20: Presented to the ED with abdominal discomfort, bloating and   indigestion. CT/AP showed 12.3 cm x 19.6 cm x 20.6 ***** mass of   suspected ovarian origin for which she was referred to ***** *****.   11/14/20: Underwent exploratory laparotomy, *****-BSO, pelvic washings as   well as biopsy of a R breast mass (***** reported lump prior to   surgery).  *****-BSO specimens consistent with leiomyomas and adenomyosis,   no evidence of malignancy. Pelvic washing negative. In the OR underwent   core biopsy of the palpable breast mass.     Breast onc history:    11/14/2020: Surgical pathology from intra-op R breast biopsy -  IDC,   modified ***** grade 2,  ER+ (98%), PR +(25%), ***** IHC 2+, FISH negative,   ***** 5%     11/11/2020: CT chest with two solid 0.2 cm pulmonary nodules in R middle   and lower lobes, mildly enlarged R axillary lymph nodes and enlarged (1.3   cm) retroperitoneal lymph nodes    12/10/2020: Bilateral diagnostic mammography with tomosynthesis, limited   right breast ultrasound. Mammogram found there is an irregular spiculated   mass with associated fine pleomorphic microcalcifications in the right   breast, upper inner quadrant, anterior third. No mammographic features of   malignancy in the left breast. Ultrasound demonstrated a 38 x 27 x 16 mm   hypoechoic, irregularly shaped solid mass with spiculated margins, in the 
   right breast, upper inner quadrant, 1:00, 1 cm from nipple. Right axilla   demonstrated several enlarged lymph nodes with cortical thickening   measuring up to 4 mm. There is an 11 x 11 x 9 mm right axillary node with   irregular shape and indistinct margins, suspicious for extranodal disease   extension.    12/10/2020 FNA of enlarged R axillary node consistent with metastatic   carcinoma    12/23/2020 MRI breast:  1. A 38 mm right upper inner quadrant breast mass corresponds to proven   malignancy. No evidence of multifocal disease or contralateral   malignancy. Recommend continued surgical and oncologic management.  2. Right level April 26 axillary adenopathy corresponds to proven metastatic   disease.  3. Nonspecific 5 mm enhancing lesion within the right upper sternum,   without apparent correlate on ***** ***** of 11/11/2020. Recommend   correlation with bone scan or PET/CT.  4. Suggestion of enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, which appear   more prominent in comparison to the prior CT of 11/11/20, although   comparison is limited due to differences in technique. Suggest   correlation with CT or PET/CT.    12/31/20 PET/CT: 1. Baseline PET/CT demonstrates hypermetabolic right breast   mass consistent with known invasive ductal carcinoma. Associated   hypermetabolic right axillary, right internal mammary, and possible right   anterior chest wall metastases.  Additional extensive fat stranding along   the right upper extremity neurovascular bundle raises the possibility of   brachial plexus involvement.   2.  Extensive hypermetabolic bilateral hilar and mediastinal   lymphadenopathy in a pattern most suggestive of sarcoidosis versus less   likely metastatic disease.   3.  *****-shaped hypodensities within the left greater than right kidneys,   favoring pyelonephritis versus less likely developing infarcts. Mild   circumferential urinary bladder wall thickening also may reflect urinary   tract infection. 
 Recommend correlation with urinalysis and symptoms.  4.  Postsurgical changes from hysterectomy and bilateral   salpingo-oophorectomy. Associated hypodensity within the right ovarian   vein favored to represent thrombus versus less likely mixing artifact.    01/07/21 Renal/kidney u/s: Normal size bilateral kidneys. No hydronephrosis   or renal calculus noted. Of note, targeted Doppler interrogation   demonstrates region with relative decreased vascularity at the left lower   pole, corresponding to the site of ***** on ***** ***** scan.   Adjacent to this, a small round focus with abnormal turbulent pulsatile   flow is demonstrated.    01/08/21 CT angiogram abdomen: Left inferior renal artery vascular   irregularity with associated inferior pole hypoperfusion, likely   representing partially thrombosed dissection with aneurysm versus   pseudoaneurysm measuring up to 0.6 cm, not definitively seen on 10/11/2020   examination. Left hepatic lobe irregular 1.5 cm hypodensity, incompletely   characterized. Right middle lobe peripheral 0.4 cm lesion, increased in   prominence compared to 11/11/2020. Total abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral   salpingo-oophorectomy postsurgical changes with associated distal right   ovarian vein thrombosis. Prominent but not pathologically enlarged   periaortic lymph nodes.     01/09/21 Endobronchial biopsy: Benign bronchial tissue.  FNA: A.  Lymph node, station 11R, endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine   needle  aspiration biopsy: Non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation; see   comment:  B.

Variant of   uncertain significance in 
 WRN      01/14/21 ***** abdomen: 1.  No MRI correlate to the previously described 1.5   cm hypodensity within the left hepatic lobe. The previously described   vascular irregularity of the left inferior renal artery is seen, but   better characterized on prior CTA exam.    01/20/21 start neoadjuvant taxol ***** followed by *****    06/02/21 ***** *****: RIGHT Breast: Interval decrease in volume, extent and   avidity of enhancement of the known right upper inner malignancy with   residual segmental non-mass enhancement measuring up to 28 x 10 x 25 mm   (AP x trans x CC extent) on MIP images (previously measuring up to 38 x 14   x 29 mm).   Kinetic evaluation demonstrates slow initial rise with delayed   persistent enhancement.  Biopsy clip artifact is noted along the   anterolateral margin of the non-mass enhancement (axial T1 non-FS image   46). LEFT Breast: No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features   of malignancy are identified. OTHER: Decrease in size of right level I and   II axillary adenopathy with biopsy clip artifact within a biopsy proven   nodal metastasis (axial T2 image 138). No left axillary adenopathy.

Ms. ***** was referred to us by  her primary care physician, Dr. ***** *****.    Ms. ***** was in her usual state ***** good health until February of this  year, when on her second routine screening mammogram on 04/06/2010 a  suspicious area was identified in the left breast and an immediate  biopsy was performed.  The results of that biopsy showed intermediate  grade ductal carcinoma in-situ with cribriform and micropapillary  patterns and focal necrosis with microcalcifications.  Subsequently, the  patient had a bilateral MRI exam of the breast which showed  new  calcifications in the left breast spanning approximately 2 cm which were  considered suspicious.    On 05/04/2010 Ms. ***** went and had a left breast biopsy which showed 3  cm of intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in-situ with comedo necrosis  and additional reexcision was performed on 05/27/2010 because of close  margins and the reexcision showed scar and biopsy site changes, some  fibrocystic changes, but no residual ductal carcinoma in-situ. The  pathology of her ductal carcinoma in-situ showed that the DCIS was both  estrogen and progesterone receptor positive.      At this time, Ms. ***** is doing well, recovering well from her  surgeries.  She has had a consultation with 
 a medical oncologist and a  radiation oncologist and she comes here as a second opinion to discuss  what further therapy might be recommended for the treatment of her  recently diagnosed ductal carcinoma in-situ.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ms. *****'s past medical history is significant  for a history of gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease,  cholelithiasis with a cholecystectomy done several years ago.    MEDICATIONS ALLERGIES:  Amoxicillin, penicillin, ***** ***** and also  aspirin and over-the-counter pain killers.    GYNECOLOGIC HISTORY:  Menarche at 13; she is continuing to menstruate  regularly at this time.  She is currently on no birth control pills, but  had taken birth control pills for approximately 11 years, beginning at  the age of 30.  She is currently living with a significant other, has a  *****-***** job as an accountant.  She never drinks.  She does not use  ***** ***** and exercises regularly.    REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She is well -developed, well-nourished.  She has no  pain.  She has some fatigue and lack of energy, but denies significant  weight loss or change in appetite.  ENT:  Denies any ENT symptoms.  She  has normal vision, with no recent change in vision.  She has no  shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.  She denies palpitations or  chest pain.  She does complaining of feeling bloating, heartburn and  indigestion, but no other GI complaints.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  She denies  any musculoskeletal symptoms.  She denies any neurological symptoms and  she has no problems with her skin or hair.    FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother who had a sarcoma.  She had a  maternal grandmother who had breast cancer at 65 and had a paternal aunt  also with breast cancer at approximately the same age.  She has no other  family history of cancer.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  On physical exam, she is a well-developed, well-nourished  female in no acute distress.  HEENT:  NCAT.  
 PERRLA; EOMs are full.  NECK:  Supple.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.  LYMPH NODES:  There is no infraclavicular, supraclavicular or axillary  adenopathy bilaterally.  CHEST WALL EXAM:  Significant for symmetric breasts, with the left  breast having a inner quadrant scar covered by a Steri-Strips from her  most recent surgeries.  This area appears to be well healing at this  time.  There is some post surgical firmness underneath that scar, but no  other abnormal masses in the left breast.  The right breast is without  abnormal mass.  HEART:  The heart is normal rate and rhythm.  S1, S2 is within normal  limits.  ABDOMEN:  The abdomen is benign.  There is no organomegaly.  Bowel  sounds are present.  EXTREMITIES:  The extremities are without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  NEUROLOGIC:  Exam is grossly intact to motor and sensory exam.    ASSESSMENT:  Ms. ***** is a 41-year-old woman with a recently  diagnosed 3 cm ductal carcinoma in-situ with comedo necrosis which was  also felt to be intermediate grade; estrogen and progesterone receptors  were positive on the ductal carcinoma in-situ tissue.  Ms. ***** had  an additional surgery after her excision because of close margins and  there was no additional ductal carcinoma in-situ at this reexcision.    I had a long discussion with Ms. ***** about our approach to the  treatment of ductal carcinoma in-situ and its nature.  I emphasized to  Ms. ***** that ductal carcinoma in-situ, although called carcinoma,  was a benign process and confined to the breast ducts.  I explained to  her that we were concerned about being sure this process did not recur,  as it had a propensity to do, because when it does recur 50% of the time  it would recur as invasive disease which could potentially threaten a  woman's life.    I explained to *****. ***** that the main approaches for the treatment of  ductal carcinoma in-situ post surgery was either with radiation 
 therapy  and/or ***** therapy with tamoxifen.  I discussed with her the  fact that radiation therapy was much more potent in its ability to  decrease recurrence of ductal carcinoma in-situ and that tamoxifen could  do the same, only was not nearly as potent as the radiation.    I discussed with her the fact that given her size of ductal carcinoma  in-situ, as well as the presence of comedo necrosis, that she had a  fairly high risk for recurrence without any further therapy.  I  estimated that risk to be about 30%.  I suggested to her that a course  of radiation therapy would decrease that risk of recurrence to  approximately 3-4%; Ms. ***** seemed to understand this well.    I went on to discuss the use of tamoxifen and suggested that in addition  to its ability to slightly decrease the risk of this current ductal  carcinoma in-situ, that it would decrease the risk of the development of  new primary invasive breast cancer by 50%.  She seemed to understand  this well.    Give Ms. *****'s history of two postmenopausal relatives with  unilateral breast cancer and her brother's diagnosis with synovial cell  cancer, it was recommended to *****. ***** that she undergo BRCA testing  and this, I believe has been performed, although I do not have the  results at the time of my consultation today.  Obviously, the results of  this would impact on any recommendations that might be made to limit Ms.  *****'s risk of developing an invasive breast cancer, but at this  time, for purposes of this second opinion, I will assume that this is  negative and could readdress the issue of prophylaxis of breast cancer  in a BRCA or other specific mutation positive patient at some later  date.    We went over some of the side effects of tamoxifen, including  postmenopausal symptomatology, although I did suggest that given her  young age she may not be rendered postmenopausal with tamoxifen therapy  immediately. We also discussed 
 the increased clotting risk and the  potential for stroke and PE, in addition to the increased risk of  uterine cancer associated with tamoxifen use.  I suggested to *****.  ***** that although there was risk with tamoxifen, that the overall  risk benefit ratio was positive. I would strongly encourage a course of  radiation therapy to decrease the risk of recurrence of her ductal  carcinoma in-situ and a coarse of tamoxifen prophylaxis is also worth  consideration.  Ms. ***** understands all this well and will return to  her primary physicians for further discussion and definitive treatment.    *****,    ***** *****, *****., PH.*****.

There is a corresponding irregular mass with indistinct margins, measuring approximately 4 cm in the inner central left breast, middle depth. There are associated fine pleomorphic calcifications within the mass.  Immediately lateral to the previously described mass, there is a second oval shaped low-density mass with obscured margins in the central lower left breast, middle depth, measuring approximately 3 cm.  In the outer central right breast, very posterior depth, there is a oval-shaped isodense mass with partially circumscribed, though some obscured margins measuring approximately 1 cm.    Ultrasound Findings:  Targeted ultrasound of both breasts was performed by a physician. At the patient-reported lump, at the 9 o'clock position, 3 cm from the nipple, there is a 3.8 x 2.1 x 3.0 cm irregular complex solid and cystic mass with surrounding vascularity.

IMPRESSION:   Left breast: Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6).  Right breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1).    July 06 bx:  FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS    Left breast, ultrasound-guided core biopsy:   1. At least ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade; see  comment.  2. Biopsy site changes and necrosis.  3. Microcalcifications with stroma and as detached fragments.       COMMENT:  The biopsy consists mostly of granulation tissue, foamy 
 macrophages,  hemosiderin and fibrin, consistent with biopsy site changes. Also noted  are fragments of necrotic tissue. Relatively scant carcinoma is sampled,  most with smooth round contour while some partially disrupted by the  granulation tissue and foamy macrophages. To further characterize the  carcinoma, the following immunostains are performed and evaluated on  block A1:    - *****: Positive around some tumor nests; negative around other tumor  nests.  - SMM: Positive around some tumor nests; negative around other tumor  nests.  - *****/6: Positive around some tumor nests; negative around other tumor  nests. Negative in tumor cells.    Positive *****, SMM and *****/6 around some tumor nests supports the  presence of DCIS. Tumor nests with negative *****, SMM and *****/6 are  largely associated with and disrupted by granulation tissue, which may  impact the staining for myoepithelial markers. Overall, the findings are  not diagnostic of invasion in this limited biopsy. Patient's prior  biopsy (*****-*****) is reviewed concurrently. Given two biopsies with  findings not diagnostic of invasion, we would recommend complete  excision for definite evaluation of invasion.    Dr. ***** ***** has reviewed this case and agrees with the diagnosis.    Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors were  performed by manual morphometry on block A1.    The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is moderate to  strong nuclear staining in ~90% of tumor cells. Internal positive  control is present, and external positive control is appropriate.    The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is variable  (ranging from weak to strong) nuclear staining in ~60% of tumor cells.  Internal positive control is present, and external positive control is  appropriate.

48,Female,Multi-Race/Ethnicity,1965-05-09,"BREAST ONCOLOGY INITIAL CONSULTATION    Name: ***** *****  *****: *****    ID: ***** ***** is a 50 y.o. female patient with a recent diagnosis of a left breast ductal carcinoma, biopsy positive LN in ipsilateral axilla, here to establish care with medical oncology prior to planned left breast mastectomy, currently scheduled for 01/06/17.     HPI: The patient presented to the ***** ***** ***** on 09/10/16 with a painful lump in her left axilla which she thought had been exacerbated after several days of intense exercise including upper body weights.  She was provided with a prescription for dicloxacillin at the ED and told to follow up with her PCP, who then referred her for a mammogram and ultrasound.     A diagnostic mammogram on 09/29/16 was notable for extremely dense breast tissue and possibly a new, partially circumscribed, partially obscured nodule (1.2 cm) at the 2:00 position in the right breast.  A targeted right breast ultrasound at the 2:00 position was notable for a hypoechoic structure (1.4 cm) that corresponded to the mammographic nodule, likely a cyst with debris.  Targeted ultrasound of a palpable abnormality in the upper outer right breast was notable for multiple simple cysts (largest 3.8 cm).  A targeted left axillary ultrasound of the palpable mass demonstrated a solid, hypoechoic mass (1.6 x 1.3 x 1.4 cm).    She underwent an US-guided left axillary LN biopsy on 10/28/16 which demonstrated metastatic carcinoma of mammary origin, with the lymph node largely replaced.  Biomarkers were notable for ER+ (60%), PR+ (70%), *****- (IHC 2+; FISH ratio 1.4).  She underwent a right breast needle aspiration of the nodule at the 2:00 position which was consistent with a cyst with reactive/degenerative cellular changes and no malignancy.    ***** underwent a breast MRI on 11/09/16 which was notable for an area of irregular asymmetric non-mass enhancement (4 x 2.5 x 3 cm) in the upper left breast, posterior third at the 
 12:00 position, 7 cm from the nipple with extension posteriorly to the pectoralis muscle without muscle involvement.  In addition, in the upper inner left breast, middle third, there was a bilobed enhancing nodule (1 cm), located 5 cm from the nipple, and 3 cm from the chest wall.  A lymph node (2.5 cm) was present in the left axilla with associated clip as well as additional prominent asymmetric left axillary LN.  The right breast was notable for scattered cysts, but no suspicious enhancing masses.    She then underwent a left breast US to look at the MRI-findings at the 12:00 position demonstrated an area of hypoechogenicity (2.3 cm). A left breast US-guided core biopsy at the 12:00 position was notable for invasive ductal carcinoma with ER+ (100%), PR+ (100%), *****- (IHC 2+; FISH ratio 1.4).  A left breast US to look at the MRI-findings at the 10:00 position demonstrated a vague hypoechoic area.  A left breast US-guided core biopsy at the 10:00 position was notable for invasive ductal carcinoma, also with ER+ (100%), PR+ (100%), *****- (IHC 0).  This biopsy was sent for ***** and resulted as low risk with a score of 11.    She underwent a PET with CT for attenuation purposes on 11/22/16 demonstrated no uptake in known left axillary LN metastasis or in the left breast, however, uptake in the bone marrow of T7-L1 was slightly more prominent, of unclear significance.  A thoracic spine MRI on 12/07/16 was notable for no evidence of metastases.    She has met with Dr. ***** ***** in ***** ***** who recommended neoadjuvant dose-dense AC followed by paclitaxel as well as Dr. ***** at ***** ***** ***** who recommended proceeding with surgical resection first to assess extent of disease.  Today patient also met with Drs. ***** and ***** regarding L breast mastectomy and reconstruction and has scheduled her surgery for 01/06/17.     She had prior biopsies in both breasts several years ago which patient reports 
 returned benign. When directly *****, patient does retrospectively recall noticing an area of fullness in the center of her L breast for the past few months which did not wax and wane as she is used to seeing with the cystic changes she experiences during her menstrual cycles.

 serious, but uncommon side effect of ***** may be an immune-mediated reaction. When this side effect occurs, it affects primarily the bowels, liver, skin, nerves and the endocrine system. This immune reaction can occur during treatment but can also be seen weeks or months after discontinuation of treatment. Symptoms of this reaction will be monitored throughout treatment (diarrhea, rash, and neuropathy). Lab work will check for elevated liver enzymes and thyroid function.    Contact your health care provider right away if you have any new or worsening symptoms.    Not all side effects are listed above. Some that are rare (occurring in less than 10% of patients) are not listed here. However, you should always inform your health care provider if you experience any unusual symptoms.    Gemzar (Gemcitabine)    Side Effects:  Important things to remember about Gemzar side effects:    Most people do not experience all of the Gemzar side effects listed.  Gemzar side effects are often predictable in terms of their onset, duration and severity.  Gemzar side effects are almost always reversible and will go away after treatment is complete.  There are many options to help minimize or prevent Gemzar side effects.  There is no relationship between the presence or severity of Gemzar side effects and the effectiveness of Gemzar.    The following Gemzar side effects are common (occurring in more than 30%) for patients taking Gemzar:    Flu-like symptoms (muscle pain, fever, headache, chills, fatigue)  Fever  (within 6-12 hours of first dose)  Fatigue  Nausea (mild)  Vomiting  Poor appetite  Skin rash  Low blood counts.  Your white and red blood cells and platelets may temporarily decrease.  This can put you at increased risk for infection, anemia and/or bleeding.  *****: Meaning low point, nadir is the point in time between chemotherapy cycles in which you experience low blood counts.

However, you should always inform your health care provider if you experience any unusual symptoms.    Carboplatin (Paraplatin)    Carboplatin Side Effects:  Important things to remember about the side effects of Carboplatin:    Most people do not experience all of the side effects listed.  Side effects are often predictable in terms of their onset and duration.  Side effects are almost always reversible and will go away after treatment is complete.  There are many options to help minimize or prevent side effects.  There is no relationship between the presence or severity of side effects and the effectiveness of Carboplatin.  The side effects of Carboplatin and their severity depend on how much of Carboplatin is given.  In other words, high doses may produce more severe side effects).    The following side effects are common (occurring in greater than 30%) for patients taking Carboplatin:    Low blood counts (including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets)  *****: Meaning low point, nadir is the point in time between chemotherapy cycles in which you experience low blood counts.

 sores  Infection  Peripheral neuropathy: Although uncommon, a serious side effect of decreased sensation and paresthesia (numbness and tingling of the extremities) may be noted. Sensory loss, numbness and tingling, and difficulty in walking may last for at least as long as therapy is continued. These side effects may become progressively more severe with continued treatment, and your doctor may decide to decrease your dose.  Central neurotoxicity:  Infrequent but patients over age 65 are at increased risk.  Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, visual changes, ringing in the ears.  Nephrotoxicity (see kidney problems):  More frequent when Carboplatin is given in high doses or to people with kidney problems.  Hearing loss (ototoxicity) - loss of high pitched sounds.  Abnormal blood electrolyte levels (sodium, potassium, calcium).   Abnormal blood liver enzymes (SGOT, Alkaline phosphatase) (see liver problems).  Cardiovascular events.  Although infrequent, heart failure, blood clots and strokes have been reported with Carboplatin use.  Less than 1% were life-threatening.   Allergic reaction may occur.  It would occur during the actual transfusion.  This may include itching, rash, shortness of breath or dizziness (especially in patients who have received cisplatin).  Not all side effects are listed above, some that are rare (occurring in less than 10% of patients) are not listed here.

She is here to discuss systemic therapy options.     We had a lengthy discussion with the patient in which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. We reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. We discussed the use of 
 locoregional therapies to reduce risk of locoregional disease and the use of systemic therapies to primarily reduce risk of systemic disease. Informed her that locoregional breast cancer is curable and that the goal would be to reduced her risk of developing systemic disease, which can potentially be incurable. Based on the currently available information, she seems to have a locoregional disease but needs to be confirmed with staging CT scans, which we have ordered today.    Because she has HR+ disease, she will need at least 5 years of hormonal therapy. Data from *****/TEXT trial demonstrated that patient who were premenopausal at their breast cancer diagnosis and recovered ovarian function after completion of chemotherapy, the combination of ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor was superior to tamoxifen in terms of preventing distant recurrence particularly in those under 35. Thus, would favor *****+*****, regardless of chemotherapy. We reviewed possible side effects from *****, including but not limited to urogenital atrophy, vasomotor symptoms, and musculoskeletal/joint stiffness or pain. We also reviewed the potential for acceleration of bone density loss associated with initiation of ovarian suppression plus an aromatase inhibitor. We also discussed the importance of exercise in helping to alleviate this symptoms.     We reviewed data from ***** trial which evaluated 5,015 patients with stage II/III breast cancer, March 30 involved nodes, and a RS ? 25. Patients were assigned to receive either endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy plus standard chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 5.1 years, there was a significant association between chemotherapy benefit and menopausal status (P = .004). The absolute benefit in this cohort was 5.2% at 5 years for disease free survival. Although it is a short follow up for HR+ disease, there was also a 1.3% absolute benefit in 5-year overall survival in the premenopausal 
 cohort. The majority of premenopausal women received adjuvant *****, not *****+***** so we still do not know if the benefit was related to ovarian suppression effects of chemotherapy or chemotherapy itself. Similar findings were seen in ***** with a MP low risk (clinical high risk) cancer. Her MP was low risk. Given her age, we will order an ***** as well to provide us with more information on her tumor biology and likelihood of benefit from chemotherapy.

The role of axillary dissection and its pros/cons have been discussed with her by Dr. *****. ***** remains with a considerable risk of systemic relapse and mortality from this cancer. Although the most accurate risk assessment is not possible without quantitative LN data from an axillary dissection, her risk is clearly high. I estimate her risk to be on the order of 60% or higher. This can be reduced with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, *****-targeting therapy. hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, and bisphosphonate therapy. These modalities were discussed.    ***** will benefit from adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Recommendation was made for adjuvant AC/THP chemotherapy. This consists of AC x 4 given q2weeks with growth factor support, followed by 12 weeks of taxol along with one year of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Side effects were discussed including potential for nausea/vomiting, alopecia, bone marrow suppression and infections, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and a small risk of secondary leukemias. As an alternative, we also discussed the TCHP regimen. This consists of 6 cycles of TCHP with one year of trastuzumab/pertuzumab. Side effects are similar with sparing of the cardiomyopathy and leukemogenic risks.     We also discussed the use of extended adjuvant neratinib in year 2 including the potential for diarrhea and the need for prophylactic anti-*****.     ***** will also benefit from adjuvant hormone therapy. A recommendation was made for Arimidex 1 mg PO daily for a duration of 10 years. This would begin at the completion of chemotherapy. Side effects were discussed 
 including the potential for ***** and myalgias, as well as acceleration of bone loss and associated complications including bone fractures. In the case of intolerable arthralgias or myalgias, treatment can be changed to other aromatase inhibitors or possibly to tamoxifen. Bone loss can be monitored by densitometry scanning and can be reduced or reversed with a number of bone strengthening agents available for this purpose. We also discussed the use of ***** infusions to maintain bone density as well as reduce the recurrence risk associated with breast cancer.    ***** requires adjuvant breast radiotherapy to complete her breast conservation management. Referral will be made to ***** at the completion of chemotherapy for a consultation and further management.    We discussed her family history and the low likelihood of an inherited susceptibility. I offered a referral to genetic counseling for further evaluation.     ***** has significant concerns about the toxicities associated with these therapies. She will be thinking about these options over the next few weeks. She also plans to return to *****, and if she is to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy, she would want to get it on the island of ***** where she lives. She also has concerns about co-pays that may be associated with treatment and her ability to work, disability options, and other practical considerations. She will be thinking about and investigating these issues over the next couple of weeks and will get back to us. We will send records to ***** when she has identified a local oncologist.

53,Female,Multi-Race/Ethnicity,1979-06-20,"ID: ***** ***** is a 39 y.o. premenopausal patient with an oligo-metastatic *****+/*****- breast cancer and a BRCA2 mutation, treated with ***** and bilateral mastectomy/left ALND, returning to clinic for regular f/u.    Date of Service: 04/30/18    Interim History:  - The patient was last seen in clinic on 04/02/18. She reports feeling better and being able to move more.    - She called in last week with concern because her incision macerated. She is continuing to have breast pain and soreness though it is improving.    - She started PT. She states that it was painful initially, but she does practice the exercises 3 x day. Her goal is to have pre-op range of motion. She has also increased her walking.    - Since starting letrozole, she notices more joint pain on feet (prior on knees only) mostly in the morning. In the beginning it was difficult to walk but she is adjusting.    - She also notes nausea in the afternoon that might have been caused by oxycodone. She is still taking oxycodone a day and her goal is to wean off it soon.     - She notes some hair thinning since starting treatment.    - She has numbness on her right foot toe pads (#***** ***** #*****). She has *****/needles on the rest of the right foot and left foot.    - She continues to have hot flashes, but adjusts to it by varying how much clothes she wears at night.  She has an appointment for her first acupuncture session.     - She is weaning Ativan and using it only when needed and ***** by increasing melatonin (20mg).and trazodone (50mg).    - She is thinking about returning to work. She was a charge nurse and worked nights on a general surgery floor. From a financial point she needs to work and she wants to return. She is looking to transition to the clinic setting.    - She is finding support in a FB group but describes it as a ""*****-hate"" because exposure to other stories causes some worry.    - See below for additional review of systems.

She is aware that in general metastatic breast cancer is not curable, but treatable, with primary goals of prolongation of life, while maintaining a good quality of life without excessive toxicities.  I noted that systemic medications are the mainstay of treatment for MBC, but that in select cases of oligometastatic disease we consider using local therapies such as surgery and radiation as has been done in her case.    She will continue with ovarian suppression as well as an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole).  We will start palbociclib when she completes radiation and has recovered from the SE.

Stage I triple negative breast cancer on the left side *****, ***** of 90%.   2.  I would recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy with dose dense AC followed by weekly taxol.  She will need a port placed.  This allows her to get rapid systemic treatment and we can assess her sensitivity to chemotherapy.   3.  It also would be fine for her to have surgery first if by MRI she has truly a stage I cancer.  The rapidity with which this can happen is crucial.  She needs to start chemotherapy no later than one month from diagnosis.   4.  MRI of bilateral breasts.   5.  Genetics consult.  Her mother had breast cancer and her May 20 sister had breast cancer in her 30s.   6.  I encouraged her to find a local oncologist for her to work with asap.   7.  We discussed the role of radiation to decrease the risk of local recurrence.  Depending on her pathology she may not need radiation if she has a mastectomy.   8.  We discussed the role of chemotherapy to decrease the risk of systemic recurrence.         ***** ***** *****, MD  Medical Oncology/Hematology    TIME SPENT: 60 minutes time on ***** patient, reviewing chart, coordinating care, discussing with patient and/or family.

E.g., TCH+P is a new standard of care regimen for ***** locally advanced cancer. Although she is likely TNBC based on ***** pathology results and review, TCH+P regimen would be expected to be beneficial given docetaxel component as well as platinum, the latter having been shown to benefit TNBC pts in the neoadjuvant setting from recent ***** and ***** trials. The addition of AC X 4 post op was eminently reasonable to complete anthracycline-taxane therapy for TNBC, with the additional potential contribution of platinum.     - Pt asked if change in ***** ***** to ""loss of time"" or other compromise, and we discussed that 1) she received all of the ***** ***** / drug classes available for TNBC and 2) timing of pre vs. Post op Rx and sequencing variations are not likely to compromise outcome in ***** *****.    - Rec additional path review at ***** given critical aspect of ***** status question.

Right Breast cancer: ***** is currently without evidence of recurrence either locally or systemically based on physical exam findings or review of symptoms. She has been seen in the Survivorship clinic  and was advised to stop Tamoxifen and switch to letrozole. However, there was no symptom improvement on letrozole so she was recently advised to switch to Exemestane. She was not aware of this recommendation. I again recommended discontinuing Letrozole and waiting 2-3 weeks before starting Exemestane to see if she tolerates it better. She understands that we still recommend at least 5 years of hormonal therapy and 
 despite her side effects, she does have intentions of continuing hormone therapy for 5 years.    She is due for her right mammogram in July. Continue mammograms alternating with MRI  and every 6 month clinical breast exam.    2. Depression: She is currently on Pristiq 75 mg. I discussed with her the value of Duloxetine for ***** induced joint pain but I am concerned about the drug interaction of these two medications. I will refer her to psychiatry to determine how to best proceed with a transition from ***** to duloxetine. I discussed with her the most common side effects of Duloxetine including fatigue, nausea, headache, and dry mouth.     3. Weight: Her weight has been stable since November/December 2017.     ***** with me in 6 months.     I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 25 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, medication risks, lifestyle modification, symptoms and therapeutic options. Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.    *****, ***** ***** am acting as a scribe for services provided by ***** ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM     The above scribed documentation accurately reflects the services I have provided.    ***** ***** *****, MD   *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM

Standard fixation in ***** ***** is 6-72 hours for all  samples. Fixation time is unknown for samples processed in other  laboratories.  A histologic section from the selected tumor block was  reviewed by a pathologist to evaluate tumor and normal tissue  morphology, and an adjacent paraffin section was used for FISH analysis.   That section was ***** with fluorescent probes from the *****  ***** (TM) ***** DNA Probe *****, which includes probes for centromere  17 (*****) and *****.  The tumor slide was denatured and subsequently  allowed to hybridize with the ***** (TM) probes.  Following  hybridization, the unbound probe was removed by a series of washes, and  the nuclei ***** with DAPI (4, 6 diamidino-2-phenylindole).   Enumeration of ***** and ***** signals was conducted by manual  microscopic examination of cell nuclei using a fluorescence microscope  equipped with appropriate excitation and emission filters.  A control  slide with both tumor showing ***** amplification and tissue without  amplification demonstrated the appropriate signal patterns.     Educational Note:  According to CAP/***** guidelines, fixed specimens should be fixed in 10%  neutral-buffered formalin for 6-72 hours; specimens fixed in other  solutions or for durations outside this range may perform differently in  this assay.  This test utilizes a laboratory modification of the  procedure for the ***** ***** (TM) ***** DNA Probe *****, which is  FDA-approved

HPI:  ***** ***** is a 49 y.o. female who has requested a second opinion on treatment options for locally advanced left breast cancer. She was referred by Dr. ***** *****. Her breast cancer history is as follows:    She first noticed a lump in her breast in December 2018. She saw her PCP Dr. ***** ***** on 03/11/19 who palpated a mass in the left breast at the 3:00 position. A mammogram and US on 03/26/19 revealed a 2.8 x 3.3 x 3.9 cm mass in the left breast 3:30 position corresponding to the palpable area of concern. They also showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left axilla. An US guided core biopsy of the left breast and left axillary LN performed on 04/01/19 revealed intermediate grade IDC that was ER+/PR+/***** (2+) by IHC, negative by FISH. There was metastatic carcinoma in the biopsy of the LN. Breast MRI performed on 04/03/19 showed a 3.8 cm lesion in the 4:00 position and 1 cm left axillary LN. PET/CT from 04/04/19 showed 2.2 x 1.8 cm breast mass and 2 enlarged hypermetabolic left axillary LNs.     She received 4 cycles of dose dense AC with Dr. ***** at ***** from 04/08/19 to 05/20/19. 05/24/19 Breast US showed an excellent response to treatment. She started paclitaxel on 05/31/19 but it was held due to neutropenia. It was again held on 06/24/19 due to elevated transaminases and was ultimately discontinued. She started weekly Abraxane on 07/05/19 and completed it on 08/30/19. Breast MRI from 09/02/19 showed a dramatic response to therapy and near total complete resolution of the mass and enhancement in the left breast.     She underwent a left partial mastectomy and ***** on 
 09/19/19 which unfortunately still contained 3.8 x 3.5 cm grade 2 IDC that was ER+/PR-/***** (2+) by IHC, negative by FISH. Lymphovascular invasion was present. A lateral margin contained 8 x 6 mm IDC and an anterior (superficial) margin contained 25 x 15 mm IDC, both with *****. April 10 lymph nodes ***** showed presence of cancer. One showed 15 mm of tumor, while another had a tumor deposit measuring 1-2 mm with extranodal tumor infiltrating the adipose tissue. There were isolated tumor cells in the third LN.  Intermediate-high grade focal DCIS was also present. Since the margins were positive after the lumpectomy, she underwent re-excision on 10/16/19 and no additional cancer was found. She started letrozole on 10/04/19.    She states that the local radiation oncologist recommended additional lymph node dissection, but ***** local surgeon ***** so she sought a second rad onc opinion with Dr. ***** *****. She proceeded with radiation to her left breast and axilla instead of additional surgery. She started XRT to the whole left breast and regional nodes on 11/26/19 at *****.     She reports discoloration and peeling on the skin after XRT. She thinks that she tolerated it well. She has not met with physical therapy.    She had a ***** IUD so she did not have regular menses for a number of years. The ***** was removed in March 2019. Upon questioning, she states that she did not experience hot flashes or other menopausal symptoms before her cancer diagnosis. However, she developed hot flashes during chemotherapy. She states that chemotherapy also affected her sleep.     She reports arthralgias with letrozole. She is not exercising as much as she used to.

CAD analysis was utilized. 3D Tomosynthesis utilized.    FINDINGS: There is vague focal asymmetry underlying the palpable abnormality in the lateral   aspect of the left breast, mid depth.  There are no suspicious microcalcifications. Density:   Category C : The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses.      ULTRASOUND:    TECHNIQUE: Multiple sonographic images were obtained of the left breast and also of the left   axilla.    FINDINGS: There is a poorly defined mass with prominent vascularity and associated shadowing in   the left breast at about 3:30, 3.2 cm from the nipple. This corresponds to the palpable   abnormality. The mass measures approximately 2.8 x 3.3 x 3.9 cm, although margins are not   well-defined.    In the left axilla there are multiple lymph nodes. These measure 1.4 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm, 1.2 x 2.0   x 2.0 cm, 1.5 x 1.7 x 2.3 cm, 0.9 x 1.9 x 2.5 cm and 0.6 x 0.7 x 1.3 cm. At least one of these   demonstrates abnormal morphology.

 fasting and a suitable delay of 60 minutes following the intravenous   administration of 15.63 mCi 18F-FDG at the right hand, 3D body imaging is performed from the   base of the skull to below the pelvis using the General Electric Discovery ST PET/CT scanner.   Initially, a low dose CT is performed for attenuation correction and anatomic correlation.   Subsequent 3.0 minute bed positions were then performed for acquisition of the PET data set   with subsequent fusion with the CT for the diagnostic data set. The patient's blood glucose at   the time of injection was 88 mg/dL.    RADIATION DOSIMETRY: CTDIvol: 5.6 mGy   Total exam DLP: 497.85 mGy-cm    COMPARISON: Pelvic ultrasound from 10/23/2008.    FINDINGS: The distribution of 18F-FDG in the visualized brain, myocardium and the urinary tract   appears physiologic.     Head and neck: There is no hypermetabolic deep cervical lymphadenopathy.     Thorax: There is a hypermetabolic mass in the outer quadrant of the left breast with associated   clip. The mass is isodense to the adjacent glandular tissue, measuring approximately 2.2 x 1.8   cm with maximum SUV 3.4. Additional note is made of 2 enlarged hypermetabolic left axillary   lymph node. The larger and more hypermetabolic lymph node measures 10 mm in short axis   dimension with maximum SUV 4.2. No enlarged right metabolic internal mammary lymph nodes are   identified.    No hypermetabolic hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is present.     There are no pulmonary nodules or pleural effusions.     The heart size appears normal. There is a trace pericardial effusion.    Abdomen and pelvis: There are no hypermetabolic lesions in the liver, adrenal glands or   retroperitoneal lymph nodes. There is a small non-FDG avid low-density lesion in hepatic *****,   likely a cyst, measuring 7 mm.    The uterus is prominent in size. There is focal linear uptake within the right side of the   uterus with maximum SUV 4.5. A 
 corresponding abnormality is difficult to visualize on the   noncontrast images.    Musculoskeletal: Spondylotic changes are present within the spinal axis. There are no   hypermetabolic or osteolytic bone metastases.    IMPRESSION:   1. Hypermetabolic mass in the outer quadrant of the left breast, consistent with known breast   cancer.  2. Hypermetabolic left axillary lymph nodes, consistent with nodal metastatic disease.  3. Somewhat linear abnormal uptake eccentric lesion within the right side of the uterus. A   corresponding abnormality difficult to determine on the noncontrast images. This could relate   to uptake within the endometrial canal that is displaced, which can be seen physiologically in   patients of reproductive age. Alternately, this could represent uptake in the endometrial canal   due to inflammatory change in this patient status post recent IUD removal. However, the   eccentric nature of the uptake is atypical for endometrial uptake. Recommend a pelvic   ultrasound for initial further evaluation to ensure that this does not correspond with a   uterine mass.      05/31/19: Brain MRI:      Technique:     Diffusion axial  Axial T2 FLAIR  Axial T2 fast spin-echo  Sagittal T1 FLAIR  Gradient echo axial  T1-weighted axial    Contrast enhanced sequences: None  Contrast dose: 6 ml IV Gadavist.

Assessment and Plan:  ***** ***** is a 49 y.o. female with locally advanced ER+/PR-/***** negative left breast cancer. She received DD-AC from *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****. She started Paclitaxel on 06/10/19, but it was discontinued on 06/24/19 due to elevated transaminases. She then received weekly Abraxane from 07/05/19 to 08/30/19. She underwent left partial mastectomy and ***** on 09/19/19 and re-excision on 10/16/19. She started letrozole on 10/04/19 and received XRT to the left breast and regional nodes on 11/26/19.    1. Breast Cancer: I had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her husband in which I reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. We discussed *****'s neoadjuvant chemotherapy and treatment effect.    Her overall response to chemo was disappointing since it appeared that she had responded much better on imaging. However, I reassured ***** that there are still treatments to reduce recurrence risk. Since the cancer was ER+, we discussed hormonal therapy and I explained the difference between SERM and *****. Since she is high risk, I would favor an ***** (along with OS or oophorectomy if she recovers ovarian function).  I recommended testing for estradiol 
 and FSH once every 1-2 months until September 2020 at least. I stressed that it is important that she is confirmed to remain  post-menopausal while on letrozole. We discussed that if she is not post-menopausal, we can administer ovarian suppression shots or she can have an oophorectomy performed. I also recommend a baseline DEXA scan to see if there is a need for a bisphosphonate. I explained that a hysterectomy is not necessary.    Additionally, we discussed ***** and the results of the ***** study. I explained the recent press releases for both palbociclib (***** study) and publication of data on abemaciclib (*****) in the adjuvant setting. I explained that while palbociclib did not show an improvement in ***** at a median FUP of about 3 years in the ***** trial, ***** did show benefit in the ***** study. We also briefly discussed the ***** study. I reviewed the side effects of ***** including diarrhea. I explained that if the medication is too hard to tolerate at 300 mg a day, she can discuss dose reduction with her oncologist.     I also explained ***** guidelines regarding imaging and tumour markers. We discussed Levulan PDT and vitamins/supplements and I do not think there would be any interaction with abemaciclib      I encouraged the patient to sign up for and utilize Mychart since this is the best way to communicate new information to me and to help determine whether a follow up visit is warranted    I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 60 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 50 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding Treatment options, side effects, clinical trials, and follow up plan . Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.    *****, ***** ***** ***** am acting as a scribe for services provided by ***** ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM     The above

She had staging studies which show a suspicious lesion in the sternum.  She is to have a biopsy of this area.  She was started on dd AC and is tolerating okay.  She is here for a second opinion.  She is asking to transfer her care to me but I stressed that it is very important for her to stay on schedule with her chemotherapy with her current oncologist.      We discussed the difference between widely metastatic disease and oligo metastatic disease.  I would treat her aggressively because she has a good long term chance of control with a single bone site involved which can be radiated and the HR+ her 2 negative phenotype.      I would add xgeva if biopsy is positive.  The biopsy of the bone is planned.

Psychologic/emotional well-being/support  She is anxious but well supported by her family.  Her cousin is with her today on the video visit.     Assessment / Plan:    1. Stage III- IV left breast cancer HR+/her 2 negative with probably metastatic disease to the sternum.   2.  She is currently on ***** and taxol planned.    3.   Biopsy is planned for sternal lesion.    4.   We discussed the treatment in patients with oligo metastatic disease.  I recommend ***** followed by taxol then surgery and radiation with additional treatment to sternum as a single site of metastatic disease.    5.  We discussed the role of surgery and radiation to decrease the risk of local recurrence.  6.  We discussed the role of hormonal blockade to decrease the risk of systemic recurrence.   7.  We discussed the role of chemotherapy to decrease the risk of systemic 
 recurrence.   8.  She is going to check with her insurance to see if she can change to our clinic.  I encouraged her to keep her chemotherapy on time with her current oncologist.   9.  If biopsy of bone is positive would add xgeva.         ***** ***** *****, MD  Medical Oncology/Hematology    TIME SPENT: I spent a total of 70 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures.

Prior to initiating the consultation, we obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.    Patient Name: ***** *****  ***** *****: 07/06/20    HPI: ***** ***** is a 48 y.o. female with a recent diagnosis of right breast IDC which is ER weak positive (2%), PR low positive (7%), ***** neg (IHC 2+, FISH 2.March 09.8=1.4) and ***** 36% with ***** and axillary LN involvement here in consultation with medical oncology to discuss neoadjuvant chemotherapy.      On 10/18/19, Ms. ***** had a screening mammogram locally in ***** ***** which showed a developing asymmetry within the central right breast. She was brought back for a diagnostic mammogram on 11/11/19, but this did not demonstrate a clear mass. US also failed to show any suspicious masses in the area of screening mammographic concern, so six month follow up mammogram was recommended.    Over the *****, she noticed a mass on the right side. On 05/29/20, right diagnostic mammogram demonstrated interval development of a suspicious group of pleomorphic calcifications within the 12:00 subareolar position with a newly apparent 2 cm mass. Right breast US confirmed the mass as 2.3 x 1.4 cm with the anterior inferior margin within  1 cm of the nipple. S also noted two other areas of concern including an irregular hypoechoic mass at the 1:00 o'clock position 5cm from the nipple measuring 1.0 x 0.9 cm and a 0.7 x 0.5 cm mass at the 2:30 position. There was also mild cortical thickening of an axillary LN that measured up to 3mm.    On 06/04/20, right breast ultrasound guided biopsy was performed at ***** ***** *****. The right breast palpable subareolar mass at 12 o'clock 1 cm from nipple returned consistent with invasive ductal carcinoma, 
 grade 2 or 3. Focal ***** was present, as well as a high-grade DCIS component. The invasive cancer was ER 2% weak, low positive, PR 7% moderate, low positive, ***** 2+, FISH negative (2.March 09.8=1.4). ***** 36%. The two other areas of concern noted on the ultrasound were also biopsied and returned benign. Biopsy of a right axillary lymph node returned with a 0.2mm focus of micrometastatic carcinoma within the lymph node tissue with no evidence of extracapsular extension.    On 06/12/20, MRI breast demonstrated a 2.6 x 1.9 x 2.3 cm oval mass within the right upper central breast, anterior depth/***** location compatable with biopsy-proven malignancy. There was no skin or nipple invasion but multiple prominent right level 1 axillary lymph nodes and an enlarged level ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****. No concerning findings in the left breast.    On 06/25/20,  PET/CT showed a hypermetabolic right breast nodule but no hypermetabolic lymph nodes and no evidence of metastatic disease.     On 07/03/20, she was seen by Dr. ***** at *****. Given her right breast IDC with axillary LN metastasis, Dr. ***** referred her to medical oncology to discuss neoadjuvant treatment and possibility of ***** clinical trial. She also ordered a ***** from the outside core and requested OSH path slides for review, both of which are pending.    Today, Ms. ***** reports she is feeling ok. She has generalized aches and pains but no focal pain and nothing new for her. She has baseline ***** with fast walking. She works as the rapid response nurse and has mild SOB pushing a hospital bed across the hospital. A TTE two years ago was normal and she thinks the dyspnea is due to her obesity (BMI 29.7). She is interested in pursuing care at ***** to consolidate her medical oncology and surgical oncology care.    ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  Patient Active Problem List    Diagnosis Date Noted    Breast cancer (CMS code) 07/05/2020     10/18/19: Bilateral screening 
 mammogram: There is developing asymmetry within the central right breast best. No suspicious masses, *****, or unexplained architectural distortion of the left breast. Incomplete- need additional imaging. ***** 0.  11/11/19: Diagnostic mammogram: Spot compression 3D/tomosynthesis views of the right breast demonstrate a less conspicuous focal asymmetry in the 12:00 o'clock position of the right breast, posterior depth. It does not appear to have discrete margins as one would expect for a mass. Appears most consistent with fibroglandular tissue.  11/11/19: Right breast ultrasound: Targeted US of the right breast fails to confirm any suspicious mass in the area of screening mammographic concern. No axillary lymphadenopathy.     Right breast IDC  05/29/20: Right diagnostic mammo: When compared to prior mammo in 11/11/19 there has been interval development of a suspicious group of pleomorphic calcifications within the 12:00 subareolar position. This is the site of the palpable lump. There is a newly apparent mass at this level that measures approx. 2cm. The anterior margin of the mass appears to be within 1cm of the nipple  05/29/20: Right breast ultrasound: A clinically palpable lump is noted at the 12:00 subareolar position. Targeted sonography reveals an irregular mass measuring 2.3 x 1.4 x 1cm from the nipple. It demonstrates multiple internal hyperechoic structures c/w calcifications on mammography. The anterior inferior margin is within 1cm of the nipple. There is also an irregular hypoechoic mass at the 1:00 o'clock position 5cm from the nipple. It measures 1.0 x 0.9cm. At the 2:30 o'clock positon in the subareolar region there is a hypoechoic mass that measures 0.7x0.5cm. There is mild cortical thickening of an axillary LN that measures up to 3mm.   06/04/20: Right breast ultrasound-guided biopsy:    Right breast palpable subareolar mass at 12 o'clock 1 cm from nipple: IDC, grade 2 or 3.

 Everywhere and scanned clinical documents.    PATHOLOGY:  See oncology timeline above. Reports from ***** ***** ***** are available in ***** ***** and scanned clinical documents.      ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  ***** ***** is a 48 y.o. female with a recent diagnosis of right breast IDC which is ER weak positive (2%), PR low positive (7%), ***** neg (IHC 2+, FISH 2.March 09.8=1.4) and ***** 36% with ***** and axillary LN involvement here in consultation with medical oncology to discuss neoadjuvant chemotherapy.      First, we reviewed her pathology and imaging results. She has weakly ER and PR positive, ***** negative disease. She has locally advanced disease with *****-proven LN involvement, but no evidence of distant metastatic disease on PET/CT.     For local control, she will need lumpectomy or mastectomy - we defer to our surgical colleagues about which is the best option for her. She will likely also need post-operative radiation.     We explained that for systemic treatment, we would recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery given that she has ER and PR low positive disease with LN involvement. We discussed the advantages of offering chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in order to assess response to treatment, and to increase the chances of breast conserving surgery. Outside the context of a clinical trial, we would recommend AC/T. We typically give the taxol first, followed by four cycles of TC. We then explained the option of clinical trial enrollment with the ISPY clinical trial. We explained that some of these arms involve getting taxol with an experimental therapy. We discussed the role of the ***** result as a screening for the ISPY 2 clinical trial. We explained that in the context of this clinical trial, patients receive paclitaxel and or an experimental regimen first, and then proceed with the Adriamycin and Cytoxan. At present, HER-2/neu negative patients are randomized to receive one of the 
 following regimens:  1. Control arm: Taxol weekly for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   2. Taxol weekly + pembrolizumab (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) every 3 weeks for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   3. ***** every 3 weeks for x 12 weeks (not with taxol), followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   4. Taxol weekly with oral olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) and durvalumab (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   5. Taxol weekly for *****-***** (a *****-9 agonist) with weekly Taxol and every 3 week Pembrolizumab for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   6. Taxol weekly with ***** (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) every 3 weeks for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   7.Taxol weekly with ***** (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) every 3 weeks and ***** 3767 (***** antibody) for 12 weeks, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles   8. ***** 985 (trastuzumab *****) - ***** ***** targeting antibody-drug conjugate for ***** low, followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles    9. Oral paclitaxel plus ***** (an oral PGP inhibitor) plus ***** (an immunotherapy/checkpoint inhibitor) with or without carboplatin followed  AC every three weeks for 4 cycles.     In order to participate in the trial, patients must undergo a baseline core biopsy for research purposes and a baseline protocol specific MRI. During the trial, patients will undergo one additional core biopsy of the breast mass in order to assess the biological changes that have occurred in the cancer in response to the ***** therapy plus chemotherapy. Patients will also undergo additional MRIs during the course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to assist in assessing response to treatment. We discussed the very ***** trial design and explained that if the patient is randomized to the non-paclitaxel 
 containing arm (such as ***** or *****), they can switch back to paclitaxel if not responding or receive it post operatively. In any of the arms, if the patient appears to have progression of her tumor either by physical exam or breast imaging, there is the option of discontinuing the study treatment and either moving on to the AC or switching to paclitaxel.     We reviewed the anticipated side effects and toxicities of chemotherapy including increased risk of infection, hair loss, fatigue, and possibility of ovarian failure. We explained that anthracyclines are associated with a small chance of causing permanent damage to the heart (estimated to be about 1% with 4 cycles of adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) and that ***** are associated with development of neuropathy which is most often transient and rarely permanent.    We also mentioned that given she was ER/PR low positive, we would still recommend 5-10 years of endocrine therapy after surgery. We did not discuss the options in length today, but can do so at a later date.    She asked about whether she could continue to work as an ICU nurse during chemo. We advised her that many patients choose to work during weekly taxol, but it will largely depend on which arm she is randomized to, as some of the experimental arms are likely to be associated with more toxicity. Most patients choose to take off time during AC and then after recovering from chemotherapy.     Plan:  -- ***** order TTE  -- Port placement  -- Chemotherapy teaching session  -- She is interested in screening for ISPY; then will need research core biopsy, research breast MRI, labs. F/u pending *****.   -- F/u results of genetic testing (done locally last Mon)  -- After surgery, she will be considered for post operative radiation and we will recommend 5-10yrs of adjuvant endocrine therapy     RTC in 1-2 weeks in person to start chemo    Patient seen and discussed with breast oncology attending

 09/05/2019    BUN 9 09/05/2019       IMAGING:   CT C/A/P 08/10/20  FINDINGS:     Chest: Consistent with the above history, a right breast 2.8 x 2.4 cm mass is in the lower outer quadrant (series 2 image 108), accompanied by a placed clip in its central hypoattenuating aspect. Juxtaposed relative to this at the inferior margin is a   lobular soft tissue mass spanning about 2.6 x 2.6 cm (series 2 image 114). This latter mass is more lobular in its margins than the mostly ovoid first mass just discussed. A right upper lobe anterior pulmonary nodule, for 4 x 4 mm, is observed (series 3   image 63). A left lower lobe posterolateral subpleural nodule is 4 x 3 mm (series 3 image 124). Another right upper lobe smaller nodule is equivocal, 3 x 2 mm against branching vessel (series 3 image 81). The left breast has coarse punctate   calcifications without a discernible mass otherwise. Bilateral axilla lymph nodes are present, without asymmetric enlargement on either side and with fatty *****, short axis ***** no greater than about 11 mm. The right thyroid lobe has a 4 mm   noncalcified sharply marginated hypoattenuating nodule (series 2 image 14). No evidence of intrathoracic or other lymphadenopathy. No other suspicious lung nodules/masses, pleural/pericardial fluid, defects in ***** ***** opacification, or   abnormalities otherwise of thyroid, other thoracic inlet aspects, other chest wall aspects or mediastinum.     Abdomen/pelvis: No evidence of malignancy identified in abdomen/pelvis. Specifically, no abnormalities with regard to gastroesophageal junction, stomach to, duodenum, liver, bile ducts, gallbladder (contracted postprandial presumably), pancreas, portal   venous system, spleen, adrenal glands, aorta/branches, IVC/tributaries, kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, uterus, ovaries, appendix, small intestine or large intestine. No adenopathy, free gas, free fluid.     Skeletal: Minimal spine degenerative 
 findings at a very slight spine tilt are noted. There are no suspicious skeletal findings. Negative for lytic, sclerotic or expansile lesions. No fractures.    IMPRESSION:     1. Right breast juxtaposed 2.8 and 2.6 cm greatest diameter masses in lower outer quadrant, one with a placed clip centrally.     2. Nonspecific pulmonary nodules, perhaps 3 up to maximum 4 mm.     3. Right thyroid lobe 4 mm hypoattenuating nodule.     4. Remainder unremarkable.     MRI breast bilateral 08/03/20  1. Right Breast - BI-RADS 6 - KNOWN BIOPSY-PROVEN CANCER.     R1, biopsy-proven malignant 3.8 cm mass with associated biopsy marker in the right breast 7:00, 4 cm from the nipple, with adjacent ***** enhancement extending along the lateral and anterior aspect of the mass, extending to the skin with associated   skin enhancement, likely combination of additional tumor involvement and postbiopsy changes. In total the abnormal enhancement spans 6 x 3.3 x 2.8 cm (AP by ***** by cc). Recommend continued surgical/oncologic management.     R2, biopsy-proven malignant 1.4 cm mass, 6:00, 8 cm from the nipple, with associated biopsy marker. The mass at least abuts the skin on MRI and on ultrasound is seen to partially extend into the skin. Recommend continued surgical/oncologic management.     No MRI correlate for the sonographic ***** altered echotexture at 6:00, 5 cm from the nipple. If it would impact clinical management, may consider ultrasound-guided biopsy of *****, note on ultrasound, ***** is between the biopsy-proven R1 and R2 malignant   masses.     A 2.2 cm area of skin thickening and enhancement the right breast 9 to 10:00 position, 6 cm from the nipple, indeterminate, recommend correlation with physical exam and histologic sampling as clinically warranted. This is separate from the R1 mass and is   not along the expected biopsy trajectory.     2 prominent low right axillary level one lymph nodes with possible cortical thickening, 
 indeterminate, recommend further evaluation with MRI directed ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided biopsy.       2. Left Breast - BI-RADS 1 - NEGATIVE. No suspicious enhancement, within limitation of the marked background parenchymal enhancement.     RECOMMEND:   Recommend continued surgical/oncologic management of R1 and R2 biopsy-proven malignant masses.     Recommend MRI directed ultrasound and possible ultrasound guided biopsy of the right axilla for evaluation of the 2 prominent low right axillary lymph nodes.     Consider ultrasound-guided biopsy of ***** if it would impact clinical management.     Clinical correlation for the focal skin enhancement the right breast 9 to 10:00 position, and histologic sampling as clinically warranted.

Other imaging:     PATHOLOGY  Breast biopsy 07/26/20  MICROSCOPIC DIAGNOSIS:   A. Breast, right 7:00 N+4, core biopsy:     --  Poorly differentiated high-grade carcinoma with squamous   differentiation (0.6cm) (provisional ***** grade III, score: 3+3+3)   (See comment)   B. Breast, right 6:00 N+8, core biopsy:     --  Poorly differentiated high-grade carcinoma with squamous   differentiation (0.35cm) (provisional ***** grade III, score:   3+3+3) (See comment)   Comment: Histologic sections of both biopsies (A and B) show involvement   by a high-grade carcinoma arranged in nests and cohesive sheets,   characterized by pleomorphic and hyperchromatic nuclei with dense   eosinophilic cytoplasm. The neoplastic cells on both blocks A1 and B1   are strongly and diffusely positive for *****, supporting squamous   differentiation. They are also positive for GATA3 and ER (1+, 5-10%) and   negative for PR (0, 0%) and Her-2 (0). Although the positive expression   for GATA3 supports a breast primary, GATA3 staining is overall a   non-specific marker, and metastasis from ***** ***** namely the bladder   and the gynecologic tract need to also be considered. While the findings   are overall 
 compatible with a breast primary (i.e. metaplastic   carcinoma), clinical and radiologic correlation is needed to exclude a   metastasis. Dr. ***** has reviewed this case and agrees with this   assessment.       Genetic/hereditary:     She is also awaiting the results of an ***** 30 ***** germline panel.

We affirmed her current treatment plan, and discussed the recent FDA approval of pembrolizumab for early stage TNBC. Her tumor is poorly differentiation and meets criteria for TNBC with an ER of less than 10% and PR of 0%:    -  We have reached out to her local oncologist Dr. ***** and have discussed this with her.   - We reviewed the risks and benefits of lumpectomy/***** vs. Mastectomy. While there is no survival benefit with mastectomy, she is still interested in pursuing a double mastectomy to avoid ongoing surveillance and potential breast biopsies. There is much opportunity to discuss  These options during adjuvant therapy  the We also discussed delaying her breast reconstruction until after her radiation therapy. She may not be an ideal candidate for implants as she may need radiation therapy depending on the findings post chemotherapy, but it may be reasonable to wait until after her radiation before pursuing reconstruction.   - We would be happy to see her again after her chemotherapy to discuss next steps.     We will also await completion of ***** 
 testing    2) Exercise  We also discussed the importance of exercise and physical activity.         Current Pain and Distress: The Pain and Distress that the diagnosis and its treatment carries were discussed, the following interventions were recommended.  No new therapy suggested.     The patient concerns were discussed in detail. Patient verbalizes understanding of these issues and agrees with the plan.  Reviewed treatment options, treatment side effects in detail.

You  already know her history, but we will summarize it here for our  records.    IDENTIFICATION:  54-year-old ***** woman with ER-negative,  *****-*****, *****-2-negative breast cancer of the left side.    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ***** ***** is a 54-year-old ***** woman  who has a history of diabetes, MRSA infection, neuropathy and  hypertension, who has been doing routine mammogram screens.  Her last  normal mammogram was in February 2010.  In February 2011, during her shower,  she noticed there was a swollen lump under her left axilla.  In the  meantime, she also noticed her left breast was more swollen, enlarged,  edematous, and was painful as well.    The patient was seen by her primary care physician.  Antibiotic, Keflex,  was prescribed.  The patient was also instructed to follow back in two  weeks.  Per patient, the swelling and pain of her left breast did not  improve after one week of antibiotic.  The 
 patient then called back her  primary care physician who referred her to Dr. *****, surgeon, for a  breast biopsy.    The patient had a diagnostic mammogram on 02/25/2011, which showed a  3-cm upper inner quadrant mass with diffuse skin thickening and left  axillary lymph node enlargement.  The patient underwent left breast  excisional biopsy on 02/25/2011.  This biopsy revealed grade 3  invasive ductal carcinoma, at least 2.5 cm, with ***** margins,  without lymphovascular invasion, *****-*****, *****-negative,  HER-2-negative.   *****-67 was at 59%.   ***** and eGFR were both positive.  In addition, skin shows a single-cell pagetoid change.  Given the large  size of the primary breast cancer, the patient was referred to *****.  *****, medical oncologist in *****.  She was planned for dose-dense  Adriamycin plus Cytoxan followed by dose-dense Taxol.  Her first cycle  of dose-dense Adriamycin plus Cytoxan was started on 04/03/2011.  At  that time she was given Adriamycin 600 mg/m2 for a total of 1320 mg (at  BSA 2.2) plus Cytoxan with ***** ***** ***** mg.  In addition, after her  chemotherapy the patient was given Neupogen at 480 mcg for a total of  three doses.  She tolerated her first chemotherapy well.  Her second  chemotherapy was on 04/22/2011.  At this time she was changed to  ***** 6 mg x1 injection postchemotherapy.    Per patient, two days after she completed her second cycle of dose-dense  Adriamycin plus Cytoxan, she started experiencing shortness of breath.  Also she developed abscesses in her buttock for which she sought medical  care with her primary care physician on 04/24/2011.   During her  clinical visit, in addition to the abscess, her primary care physician  also noticed she was more dyspneic.  The patient was sent to the  emergency room to have further workup.  A chest x-ray shows right-sided  middle lobe pneumonia.  In the meantime, she was also found to be  pancytopenia with WBC 0.9, ANC 
 0.5, hemoglobin 6.3, hematocrit 18.5,  platelet count 58K.  Per patient, she was given 4 units of blood  transfusion and antibiotics with vancomycin  and levaquin were started  as she had a history of an MRSA infection and she had an active  abscess.    On 04/29/2011 the patient developed severe dyspnea.  CT angio was  obtained to rule out pulmonary emboli, and she was negative for  pulmonary emboli; however, the CT scan did reveal that she had worsening  pleural effusion, especially on the right side.  She underwent a  pleurocentesis. Only a small amount of fluid was withdrawn to rule out  malignancy involvement.  Per patient, this test was negative for cancer  cell; however, we do not have the official report.  For her pleural  effusion she was treated with Lasix with good improvement.    On 04/30/2011 the patient underwent incision and drainage of her  right buttock abscess.  A total of two incisions were performed, and her  cultures did show that she had MRSA infection.    Per patient, during her hospitalization she was informed that given her  severe side effects secondary to chemotherapy, she is not a candidate  for further chemotherapy treatment.  The patient was also told that  given her poor nutrition and her profound pancytopenia, she is not a  candidate to undergo breast cancer surgical resection.  The patient was  referred to ***** by her medical oncologist, Dr. *****, for a second  opinion and for further management.    She is here today, accompanied by her brother.  Her symptoms have  resolved.  She denies any dyspnea.  She only had a mild buttock pain.  She is currently at her baseline energy level.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.       MRSA infection of her stomach.  Per patient, it was a deep and  large infection, and she had to undergo several d *****.  This was  in 2005, and her infection showed MRSA.  2.  Diabetes.  3.  Neuropathy secondary to diabetes of bilateral feet.  4.  Glaucoma.  5.

IMAGING STUDIES:  04/29/2011, CT angio: No evidence for pulmonary  embolism.  Interval development of bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis  and mild left and mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion since March 27,  2011.  Edema and 
 skin thickening of the left breast and left axillary  lymphadenopathy.    PATHOLOGY:  Left breast excisional biopsy shows high-grade invasive  ductal carcinoma, 2.5 cm in diameter tissue; cancer present at the  margin.  No angiolymphatic invasion.  Left breast skin - possible single  cell pagetoid change, identification pending IHC.    Estrogen receptor was negative.  Progesterone receptor was negative.  HER-2 was negative.  *****-67 was high at 59%.  ***** was positive.  EGFR  positive.    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  ***** ***** is a 54-year-old postmenopausal  ***** woman who has a newly diagnosed left-sided breast cancer.    1.  Clinical stage II-III left-sided triple negative breast cancer.  The      patient had a recent diagnosis of left-sided breast cancer.  Her      cancer is associated with several high-risk factors including triple      negative, is relatively large in size with possible lymph node      involvement.  Fortunately, she does have a chemo-sensitive breast      cancer.  She only underwent two cycles of dose-dense Adriamycin plus      Cytoxan and she noticed a decrease in size of her left axillary      lymph node, likely from 8 cm to right now 2-3 cm.  In addition, her      left breast mass also decreased in size with less swelling.  Her      last chemotherapy was 04/19/2011, which was more than one month      ago.  She has not noticed any growing of her breast cancer, either      in her left breast or in her left axilla, suggesting patient does      have relative chemo-sensitive breast cancer.  However, her multiple      medical conditions would put her at high risk for chemotherapy,      which will need to be further improved before her next cycle of      treatment.             The patient has not well-controlled diabetes.  Her blood sugar      in general was around 200, and when she was on chemotherapy her      blood sugar was more than 400 mg/dL.  This not well-controlled      diabetes would make 
 the patient prone to severe infection, which she      did develop after two cycles of Adriamycin plus Cytoxan with an      MRSA-positive abscess on her buttock.  In order for her to receive      further chemotherapy, it would be important for her to have relative      good control of her blood sugar.  We recommend the patient to      immediately contact her diabetes physician to have her blood sugar      well controlled.             Cardiac function.  The patient did develop a pleural effusion.      We reviewed Dr. *****'s notes during her hospitalization.  The      patient does not have a systolic dysfunction; however, she might      have a diastolic dysfunction.  She had an echocardiogram and an      adenosine stress test recently and we would like to obtain those      records to further evaluate her cardiac function post *****      treatment.  The likelihood of her developing cardiotoxicity from two      doses of Adriamycin is relatively low; however, there are patients      who are very sensitive to Adriamycin who might develop immediate      acute cardiac toxicity.             Abscess.  Her abscess has improved since the incision and      drainage and she completed her antibiotic treatment.  However, per      our exam she still has clear drainage from her abscess.  We suggest      patient to follow up with her surgeon.  Packing may speed up the      healing process, which will help patient to be ready for      chemotherapy soon.        Plans:        # We would like to obtain whole-body staging such as PET/CT scan      to rule out any distant metastases.        # We would like to obtain a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound to      evaluate her left breast cancer in order to obtain a baseline for      further comparison.        #  Regarding her chemotherapy regimen, we agree at this time that      she is not a candidate for further Adriamycin and Cytoxan.  However,      she does have a very chemo-sensitive 
 triple negative breast cancer      and we would like to give her the best chemotherapy regimen possible      to cure this disease.   We recommend starting Abraxane now at a      weekly dose for a total of 12 weeks which can replace the weekly      Taxol in this regimen.  Abraxane can be given at 100 mg/m2 weekly  for a total of 12 weeks, which will give us three months' time to better  manage her diabetes and hopefully at that time the wound will further  heal.  If at that time her general health condition improves, we would  like to give her an additional two cycles of dose-dense Adriamycin plus  Cytoxan.  In general, we support this chemotherapy with *****  injection to prevent neutropenia or neutropenic fever.  To further  decrease her risk for an infection, we would also recommend starting her  on Levaquin post dose-dense AC cycle to prevent infection.           # We will also obtain her pathology specimens we reviewed here at      UCSF and to repeat her ER/PR and HER-2 status and confirm that she      has a negative status.        # Genetic counseling.  The patient developed triple negative      breast cancer at the age of 53, and without family history we would      like patient to meet with our genetic counselor to consider whether      genetic tests would be needed to rule out mutation.      We plan to start her chemotherapy on 06/05/2011 with prior      laboratory tests to evaluate her CBC, renal function, and liver      function.      Thank you very much for referring this lovely patient to our care.    ***** *****. *****, M.D.  CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE  UCSF COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER  ***** ***** ***** BREAST CARE CENTER    I have seen and examined the patient.

 which is  with biopsy-proven axillary LN involvement.    We should begin by completing her staging with a PET/CT to be ordered today.  Assuming there are no distant mets, her cancer has a less aggressive biology (HR+ and *****, low *****) but with concern for high burden of nodal disease given +R axillary FNA and multiple concerning LN on imaging.  Regardless of next steps, she will receive at minimum 5, but more likely 10 years of hormonal therapy with an aromatase inhibitor as a cornerstone of her systemic cancer therapy.  As far as chemotherapy, with her strongly HR+ low grade, lobular biology, she may derive less benefit from chemotherapy than hormone therapy, but given her disease burden we cannot say she will derive no benefit from chemotherapy.  We think it is reasonable to send molecular profiling assay (ie. ***** *****) to help determine her benefit from chemotherapy, and how to proceed, acknowledging that these assays were developed for node negative or June 12+ nodes. This can be done as part of trial screening (*****, see below) or off trial.  This can help guide what kind of neoadjuvant treatment to pursue.     Given her preference for BCT if possible, we want to do everything possible to give her a ***** acceptable result.  Also we want to assess the degree of responsiveness of her tumor to systemic therapy.  *****, a neoadjuvant systemic approach is warranted to achieve these goals.  If her ***** ends up being low risk, we may consider 4-6 months of neoadjuvant hormone therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (given post-menopausal status) in hopes that she will have a response and can be a BCT *****.   An alternate option for low risk disease would be an available neoadjuvant trial we have combining hormone therapy with a ***** alpha subunit inhibitor, which we can discuss in a future visit. I told her even if we take an ***** approach, if we find that she has extensive ***** at surgery 
 she would likely still need chemotherapy.   If her ***** ends up being high risk, I would recommend ***** including ***** on ***** trial.      The patient voiced understanding and is interested in learning about ***** . She met with the coordinator today and screening consent was provided.  She was advised to let us know how she'd like to proceed, the sooner the better since it takes ~2weeks for the genomic tests to return.  She understands that ***** screening requires repeat  MRI breast and repeat biopsy.    -PET/CT ordered  -await ***** as part of ***** screening, or ***** if she ***** not to screen for ISPY.  -will schedule repeat MRI breast and biopsy if she ***** to screen for ISPY  -F/U with Dr. *****       This pt was seen and discussed with attending ***** *****.    1. The patient concerns were discussed in detail. Patient verbalizes understanding of these issues and agrees with the plan.   2. Reviewed treatment options, treatment side effects in detail.   3. I reviewed the patient's medical information and medical history.   4.

Physical Exam:  This was a video visit    Impression  ***** clinical prognostic stage IIIB (*****) left breast cancer, ER/PR positive, ***** negative    Assessment/Plan:  Status of disease and management recommendations were discussed at length with *****. She has a cancer that is locally advanced. The rib finding on the PET scan may or may not be a site of metastasis, but it is too subtle and too late to attempt a biopsy with high confidence. Therefore I think the stage IIIB staging is reasonable to pursue at this time. Should more convincing and accessible sites of distant metastasis present themselves in the future, this can be pursued with the appropriate diagnostic biopsies and the stage revised if necessary.    ***** has a high risk of systemic relapse and mortality from this cancer if it is managed by surgery alone, a risk that I estimate to be greater than 80%. This can be reduced by several modalities including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, bone therapy, radiotherapy, and possibly newer modalities under investigation. These were discussed individually.     Chemotherapy can substantially reduced her risk of recurrence and mortality from this cancer and was recommended. Chemotherapy can be 
 administered in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings with equivalent benefits on long term outcomes outcomes (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). However there are certain advantages to the neoadjuvant timing. These include the opportunity to confirm the in ***** response, the powerful prognostic information provided by pathologic response status (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****), and the opportunity for salvage therapies or clinical trials should there be extensive residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy ***** a high risk of relapse.  She has already started on neo-adjuvant AC/taxol chemotherapy and I concurred with this (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). This consists of 4 cycles of AC at 60/600 mg/m2 given every 2 weeks with growth factor support followed by taxol given either in 4 doses of 175mg/m2 q2weeks or in 12 weekly doses of 80mg/m2. Side effects were discussed including a potential for nausea, vomiting, alopecia, immune suppression and infections, fatigue, neuropathy. Long term sequelae include 1-2% incidence of cardiomyopathy (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****) and 0.5% incidence of secondary myeloid neoplasms (***** ***** *****).     ***** will be having surgery after the completion of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Considering her locally advanced disease, it may be wise to perform an axillary dissection, and if feasible, to identify and remove the subpectoral LNs as well. The feasibility of this is best determined by ***** and may require a repeat scan post-chemo to determine the extent of residual macroscopic disease. ***** refer to ***** at ***** should she wish to pursue surgery here.     ***** will benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy for a duration of up to 10 years. Both tamoxifen and AIs are effective with AIs showing superior efficacy 
 in randomized trials (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****). Side effects of tamoxifen were discussed including potential for hot flashes, mood effects, increased incidence of thromboembolic events and endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. Side effects of AIs were discussed including *****, myalgias, and potential acceleration of bone loss. Although AIs are restricted to the postmenopausal state, ***** has high risk disease and will benefit from the superior efficacy afforded by AIs. This was confirmed in the combined analysis of the SOFT and TEXT trials wherein ovarian suppression with aromatase inhibitor therapy was the optimal hormonal therapy modality in premenopausal patients (***** ***** *****). ***** will likely be peri-menopausal at the completion of chemotherapy and may require ovarian suppression for a period of time. Alternatively ***** therapy with continuous estradiol monitoring for a period of time may establish a permanent menopausal status without the need for suppression.    The bone loss associated with postmenopausal use of AIs can be ***** with anti-resorptive bone agents. In addition to beneficial effects on bone, the use of ***** or denosumab every 6 months for 3 years in post-menopausal patients with early stage breast cancer is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer recurrence (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), providing additional benefit to their use in this patient population. Side effects of zoledronic acid and denosumab were discussed including a rare risk of ***** with no cases confirmed in the *****-12 or *****-18 studies (***** ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** *****), but 2% in the more intense schedule of the ***** trial (***** ***** *****), and a rare risk of atypical femoral fractures at a rate of under 0.2% (***** ***** *****) with no cases confirmed in the *****-18 study (***** ***** *****). Zoledronic infusions 
 can also be associated with flu-like symptoms typically with the first infusion.    In addition, we discussed the emerging role of ***** inhibitor therapy in the treatment of ER positive breast cancer. The addition of ***** inhibitors is associated with significant DFS and survival benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer (***** ***** *****; ***** ***** *****). Phase 3 studies in early stage breast cancer have been completed but the outcomes data are not yet available. Press releases from ***** and ***** ***** have reported mixed results for adjuvant palbociclib and abemaciclib. This may be due to differences in risk categories accrued or may be due to differences in the agents or other study designs and can only be intelligently evaluated when the data is presented or published. The ribociclib phase 3 study is open at ***** (*****) and this remains an option should it still be open to accrual when ***** reaches her hormone therapy period. Alternatively ***** inhibitors may be used off label in this high risk case with her knowledge and consent.    ***** will benefit from post-operative radiotherapy whether she ***** breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy.  The high risk nature of her disease including the extensive LN involvement portend a high risk of local relapse and mortality that can be reduced by RT even in the post-mastectomy setting (***** ***** *****). In addition to the treatment of the breast or chest wall and regional LNs, ***** may chose to treat the semi-suspicious left lateral rib lesion with stereotactic RT. Indeed the management of oligometastatic breast cancer with stereotactic radiation approaches can result in considerable durations of disease control and survival, ***** when the oligometastatic site is in bone (***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** ***** *****)(***** Int J Radiat ***** Biol Phys 2019; 104:1194).    ***** will be continuing her 
 management at ***** and will return to us as needed for additional consultations. Today's consultation was based on the available medical records.

 drain placement on 03/03/22.     1. Left breast cancer: I had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her daughter in which I reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. Today, we discussed her pathology report which demonstrates a number of favorable characteristics including high ER positivity and relatively small size of resected tumor. However, there are a number of findings including  *****-67 of 20%, lack of expression of PR, and increase in grade from the core biopsy from grade 1 to grade 2 on the surgical specimen which creates some concern that  this cancer may be more high-risk. I recommended she begin endocrine therapy for a minimum of 5 years or longer, but we will plan to get an ***** to evaluate the potential benefit of chemotherapy.     In terms of hormonal therapy, I explained that aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have improved outcomes in terms of DFS as compared to tamoxifen. I also discussed the data from *****, *****, and ***** ***** which demonstrated modest benefit of extending hormonal therapy beyond 5 years. I explained that the decision to continue the aromatase inhibitor beyond 5 years should be an individualized decision based on the patient's risk and tolerance of hormonal therapy.    I reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with an aromatase inhibitors including arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss. I explained that the joint pains are often the most difficult side effect to manage, and not infrequently, patients will switch to another aromatase inhibitor.    Plan  - Instructed patient to begin letrozole, prescription ordered.  - Ordered ***** to evaluate potential benefit of chemotherapy.

For her GI Oncology history, she is followed by Dr. ***** ***** of UCSF.  She was initially diagnosed in July 2015 with metastatic *****-positive gastric cancer and had a good response to combination of *****/trastuzumab x 12 cycles, and maintenance trastuzumab alone (completed in November 2016).       She was initially diagnosed with breast cancer on a March 2017 screening mammogram, which identified a 1.3 cm irregular density of her outer center right breast.  On 05/10/2017 she underwent an ultrasound guided R breast vacuum assisted core biopsy with pathology revealing ER positive (>95%), PR positive (>90%), ***** negative (ICH 1+, FISH ratio 1.1), ***** ~15%.  She was evaluated in ***** ***** ***** clinic on April 2717 by Dr. ***** and was admitted to ***** on *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/***** for bilateral simple mastectomy and right axillary ***** with ***** closure.  She was last evaluated in breast oncology surgery clinic on 08/02/17 where she had her last drain removed.  Of note is that her original gastric pathology was re-reviewed by UCSF pathology in light of her new breast cancer diagnosis and it confirmed her original diagnosis of ***** positive gastric adenocarcinoma, a separate process from her current breast cancer.  Given this is her second primary malignancy she was evaluated by genetics, and results from 06/30/2017 showed the ""only finding on this

She now presents to establish medical oncology care.      After surgery she became more fatigued and tired; on average she only spends 3-5 hours outside of bed.  Is able to walk for two blocks before having to stop to rest.  Feels very fatigued.  Experiencing upper right anterior thigh numbness since surgery, no weakness or numbness in her lower leg.  Feels as though her surgical sites are starting to heal, but she is having fullness and mild discomfort lateral to her right surgical site.    Of note, her niece passed away from breast cancer in her 40s.  Nobody else in her family with cancer, including ovarian or pancreatic cancer.  Never smoked tobacco, but her ex-husband smoked for estimated 6-8 years.  Had a hysterectomy at age 46.  Is unsure if she has ever taken HRT.

CONSULTATION PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS  Review of *****-*****-***** from ***** *****, *****, *****:    C. Stomach, biopsy:   1. Invasive adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, 
 consistent with  gastric primary; see comment.  2. Gastric mucosa with intestinal metaplasia.    COMMENT:   H&E sections show multiple fragments of gastric mucosa containing  tumor composed of irregular glands lined by atypical cells. Tumor  necrosis is present. The depth of tumor invasion cannot be assessed due  to the superficial nature of the tissue fragments. The background  demonstrates extensive ***** debris with fungal organisms and  intestinal metaplasia in gastric mucosa. ***** (HER-2 and mucicarmine)  performed by the original institution are available for review.  Mucicarmine highlights intestinal metaplasia and demonstrates minimal  luminal staining in tumor glands. HER-2 is positive (3+, scale 0-3) in  tumor cells. By report, the patient's previously resected breast  carcinoma (*****-*****) shows no ***** ***** amplification by FISH.    Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings support a  diagnosis of invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, most  consistent with a gastric primary.

TECHNIQUE:Right breast ultrasound was performed, with evaluation   focusing only on specific areas of concern.The breast was not   scanned in its entirety.    FINDINGS:In the lateral, 9:00 position of the right breast, near the   chest wall, a lobular 1 cm hypoechoic mass is identified. This is   best seen with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position   with the breast falling forward. There is posterior acoustic   shadowing. This lesion corresponds to the mammographic abnormalities.    CONCLUSION:Ultrasound defined a lobular, 1 cm hypoechoic shadowing   lesion in the 9:00 position of the right breast, near the chest wall.   This 
 corresponds to mammographic abnormalities. This is suspicious   for malignancy. An ultrasound guided core needle biopsy is   recommended.

CONCLUSION:Status post ultrasound-guided vacuum assisted core needle   biopsy of a solid mass in the 9:00 position of the right breast.A   tissue marker was left at the site of biopsy.      04/19/2017 TTE Conclusions:  Image quality was fair. The patient's blood pressure was 125 mmHg/60 mmHg during the study. The heart rate during the study was 71. Spectral Doppler was utilized for this exam. Color Flow Doppler was utilized for this exam.  1. The left ventricular volume is small. LV function is borderline to mildly decreased. LV ejection fraction is is estimated to be 50 to 55%. There is no left ventricular hypertrophy. No segmental wall motion abnormalities present.  2. The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal.  3. Left atrial size is normal. Right atrial size is normal.  4. There is no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  5. There is Doppler evidence of impaired LV relaxation. LV filling pressure is likely normal.  6. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure cannot be determined due to the lack of a complete ***** jet.  7. No pericardial effusion noted. The inferior vena cava is small with spontaneous collapse consistent with hypovolemia.  8. Aortic root

Ms. ***** has stage IIB IDC, an early stage breast cancer, with involvement of 1 lymph node.  She has completed bilateral mastectomies and at this time does not require radiation therapy.  Given her positive hormone status, she should be treated with an aromatase inhibitor.  However, it is unclear at this time if she would also benefit from chemotherapy.  Given her node positive status, it would be helpful to obtain ***** or ***** testing on her tumor to determine if she is high or low risk, which would then help guide management decisions about the role of chemotherapy.  Due to her current marginal functional status, history of chemotherapy with *****/Herceptin ***** cycles and borderline reduced EF (50-55%) on her last TTE, we would not choose an anthracycline based regimen for systemic chemotherapy.  Instead, we would pursue treatment with TC in the setting of high-risk disease as determined by the previously mentioned testing.    We discussed the possibility of only using an ***** vs using TC then an ***** with the patient and her daughter today.  They are in agreement to pursue further tumor testing and she was consented for ***** today.      Plan:  - patient consented and order submitted for ***** testing  - will consider the use of ***** alone vs TC then ***** based on the testing results  - patient to follow-up in 3 weeks to discuss future treatment options    All of the patient's questions and

We next discussed treatment.  In general it has been thought that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may offer the opportunity to downstage a tumor prior to resection and thus facilitate breast conservation, with no difference in ***** or OS vs ***** surgery. However, new evidence is emerging regarding the efficacy of adjuvant ***** targeted therapy in the setting of residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment (***** 2019;380:617-28), with improved DFS and a trend towards improved OS. Therefore, we recommend neoadjuvant treatment.    There are multiple reasonable regimens, although we suggest TCHP (docetaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks for 6 cycles with concurrent ***** and pertuzumab) or ***** (weekly paclitaxel with carboplatin, administered every three weeks or weekly, with concurrent trastuzumab and pertuzumab). Adjuvant treatment selection will be guided by an assessment of tumor response at resection, including the potential option ***** cycles of *****-***** emtansine if there is not a complete response to neoadjuvant therapy.    We briefly discussed treatment side effects including hair loss, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and risk of infection, but left a full discussion for formal chemotherapy teaching.    We also discussed the need for radiation therapy and surgical resection. We will refer Ms. ***** to the UCSF Breast Surgery clinic for consultation regarding surgical resection.  Following surgical resection we will plan to refer Ms. ***** to Radiation Oncology. 
     PLAN:  - Agree with neoadjuvant TCHP  - Agree with port and TTE prior to chemotherapy  - Agree with pending genetics counseling and fertility referrals  - We will order referral to UCSF Breast Surgery   - await germline testing results    Seen and discussed with Dr.  ***** *****    ***** *****, MD, PhD  Hematology/Oncology Fellow, PGY-4  UCSF    I spent a total of 60 minutes face-to-face with the patient and greater than 50% of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis & treatment of breast cancer.

PATHOLOGY AND GENOMICS:  See extended problem list above    Assessment and Plan      ***** ***** is a 52 y.o. female with a recent diagnosis of right breast cancer (s/p right lumpectomy with 2.2cm grade 2 IDC ER+/PR+/*****-, February 27 *****, ***** 5), here to discuss adjuvant therapy.     First, we reviewed her pathology which showed 2.2cm grade 2 IDC ER+/PR+/*****-, February 27 *****. We explained that this is a highly curable cancer and we hope to reduce the risk of recurrence with adjuvant therapies.    For locoregional therapy, she already underwent right breast lumpectomy with IORT. Given her positive LN, she is scheduled for adjuvant radiation therapy with Dr. *****.     For systemic control and prevention of future breast cancer recurrence, we discussed the importance of endocrine therapy at length. ***** thinks that she is post-menopausal but we will get an estradiol now to check, and then repeat again on treatment in 3-6 months. Assuming her estradiol is negative, we will start an aromatase inhibitor and prescribed exemestane today. We prefer an aromatase inhibitor over tamoxifen in her case given that is stabilized on duloxetine which ***** with tamoxifen, she already has fatty liver disease with slightly elevated LFTs, and her clot risk may be higher due to her relative immobility. We reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with aromatase inhibitors including but not limited to arthralgias, increased risk of bone thinning/osteoporosis, urogenital symptoms, hot flashes, fatigue, hair thinning, vaginal dryness, and mood lability. We discussed that she has baseline joint pain due to her fibromyalgia, so we will monitor this closely. She is already on duloxetine which has been shown to help, and is on celebrex as well. We recommend NSAIDs for joint pain 
 if needed.     In terms of deciding whether she would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, we discussed the value of ***** score in making this decision.Given her low ***** score of 5, we do not recommend chemotherapy in her case.     Recommendations:  # Breast cancer  -- Baseline labs now including estradiol, hep serologies given elevated LFTs  -- Prescribed exemestane, which she can start after estradiol confirms post-menopausal status  -- Proceed with adjuvant radiation therapy  -- In the future: DEXA scan (will need to discuss plan for scan as described below)  -- Check estradiol again in 3-6 months to ensure still in menopause    # Anxiety/PTSD  ***** has severe anxiety/PTSD for which she is followed by Dr. ***** *****. Lying on her back and enclosed places/scans can cause severe anxiety.

 in the management of the patient. I reviewed, verified, and revised the note as necessary.     52 yo woman with new right breast cancer and a number of co-morbidities here to discuss rx options.    06/01/2020 she had a screen detected right breast abnormality that was grade 2 IDC, ER/PR+ and *****- with ***** 10-12%.  An ***** before surgery was 5.  She could not tolerate an MRI due to PTSD/anxiety.    On 08/27/20 she had a lumpectomy and ***** with IORT for a 2.2 cm grade 2 IDC with associated DCIS and 1/1 positive nodes, with 1.1 cm of disease.  ER/PR+ and ***** now 15%.    Dr. ***** recommended radiation therapy for 3 weeks, with sedation for her simulation due to anxiety.    PMH includes morbid obesity, hepatic steatosis, IBS, fibromyalgia, arthritis, anxiety, borderline HTN.  Actively treated by psychiatry, on cymbalta and celebrex.  She is taking ***** for hot flashes.    Married, lives with her husband G0P0.  Amenorrheic since age 50.    On exam her surgical incision is well healed, she has a rash in the right axilla.    I reviewed and interpreted her pathology, imaging and labs as summarized above and here.  Her labs labs were July 23 and showed a mild elevation in ***** and alk phos    IMP  52 yo woman with unknown menopausal status and newly diagnosed T2N1, stage IIb, HR+ disease with low ***** score and multiple medical problems.  We discussed risk of recurrence from her node positive disease, and the use of endocrine therapy.  We are concerned about the drug interaction with tamoxifen and cymbalta and the joint pains with aromatase inhibitors.  In addition, she would not be able to have a bone density as she is not able to tolerate scans.    Discussed in detail    1. Proceed with radiation therapy - will start end of September 29. Laboratory studies including an estradiol, vitamin D, hepatitis serologies  3. If she is menopause, we could try an ***** - perhaps starting with exemestane.  Cymbalta has been shown 
 to reduce joint pains with AIs as well.    Plan to check labs, then start aromatase inhibitor, with ***** about 8 weeks later.    I spent a total of 75 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures.

Restaging evaluation/assessment of response to therapy.    COMPARISON: Prior PET/CT at ***** ***** ***** Imaging Center on 10/31/2019. A CT of the   chest, abdomen, and pelvis on 12/06/2019 and a whole body bone scan on 11/21/2019 are also   reviewed.    TECHNIQUE: At the time of this study, the patient's fasting blood glucose was 93 mg/dL and her   weight was 199 lbs. Approximately 70 minutes after the intravenous administration of 12.0 mCi   of 18-FDG, PET emission images and CT (dose-limited, without CT contrast) transmission images   were acquired from the top of the head to the mid thighs. The PET images were subsequently   corrected for tissue attenuation, fused with the CT images, and reconstructed for review in   orthogonal and 3D rotating (MIP) projections.  (CT dose information: CTDIvol = 9.9 mGy, DLP = 956.50 mGy-cm)    FINDINGS:  Head and Neck: There is relatively symmetric physiologic brain 
 activity (though evaluation of   the brain on this study is limited). There is physiologic tonsillar, salivary gland, and oral   activity. There is mild atherosclerotic calcification of the carotid arteries, left slightly   greater than right. There is no discrete or intense thyroid hypermetabolism, nor intensely   hypermetabolic adenopathy within the neck.    Thorax: There is persistent subtle irregularity/nodularity of the bilateral breast tissues,   similar to prior study. In particular, there is an approximately 1.4 cm faintly hypermetabolic   density within the right lateral breast on CT images 119-***** with SUV 1.0 (previously similar   in size with SUV 0.8). There are other very faintly hypermetabolic nodular densities within   the both breasts, including an approximately 1 cm density within the right superolateral breast   (CT image 104, SUV 1.2) and an approximately 2 cm elongated density within the left lateral   breast (CT images 124-*****, SUV 1.3). These findings also appear relatively stable from prior   study. There are no definitive new or intensely hypermetabolic breast lesions on either side.    The numerous hypermetabolic right axillary and right subpectoral lymph nodes seen previously   has significantly improved with interval therapy. For example, there is a residual 2.1 x 1.0   cm right axillary node with an internal biopsy clip/marker on CT image 90 with SUV 1.9   (previously 2.3 x 1.5 cm with SUV 15.1), as well as a residual 1.2 x 1.0 cm right lateral   subpectoral node on CT images 83-84 with SUV 1.8 (previously 1.8 x 1.6 cm with SUV 9.6). There   are other scattered residual right axillary and right subpectoral nodes that have similarly   significantly declined in size from prior study, and now demonstrate little (if any)   appreciable metabolic activity. These findings are consistent with extensive locoregional   nodal metastatic disease that has substantially improved with 
 interval therapy. Scattered   small, faintly hypermetabolic left axillary lymph nodes are most likely benign/reactive. There   is no significant hypermetabolic internal mammary, hilar, or mediastinal adenopathy.    There is a persistent Port-A-Cath within the left anterior upper thoracic wall (distal catheter   tip near *****/right atrial junction). Within the lungs, there are scattered areas of presumed   atelectasis or inflammation, particularly in the right thoracic paravertebral region (e.g. on   CT images 77-80 and 79-102), as well as presumed atelectasis or mild inflammation within the   lingula. Conversely, a prior hazy/ground-glass opacity within the posterior right lower lobe   has diminished or resolved. There are probable tiny, partially-calcified scars/granulomas   within the left apex laterally (CT image 76) and at the left posterior lung base (CT image   119), also seen previously. There is mild probable left apical scarring (CT image 71), as well   as a suspected tiny (3-4 mm) nodule within the right medial lung apex (CT image 74). There is   significant respiratory motion, limiting evaluation for other potential small/tiny lung   nodules. However, there are no discretely or intensely hypermetabolic lung nodules or masses.    There are no substantial pleural or pericardial effusions. There is suggestion of a small   hiatal hernia. The heart appears borderline/mildly enlarged, with mild coronary arterial   atherosclerotic calcification.    Abdomen and Pelvis: There is physiologic hepatic and splenic metabolic activity, with mildly   asymmetric elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The gallbladder is not well evaluated on this   study, with suspected cholelithiasis (better seen previously). There is no significant   abnormal adrenal or pancreatic hypermetabolism. There is no evidence of an abdominal aortic   aneurysm.    There is physiologic GI activity, with relatively prominent, 
 non-discrete proximal colonic   activity most likely reflecting normal variation. There is extensive stool within the rectum.    There is physiologic urinary radiotracer excretion, with moderate bilateral renal cortical   scarring. There is no definitive abnormal uterine hypermetabolism. The lower pelvis is again   suboptimally visualized on low-dose CT due to extensive streak artifacts from the patient's   right hip prosthesis. Small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes are likely benign/reactive, with no   intensely hypermetabolic subdiaphragmatic adenopathy.    Musculoskeletal: There is relatively prominent muscle tension/strain in the left subscapular   region and adjacent to both hips. There are other scattered areas of presumed subcutaneous   inflammation or edema, particularly within the patient's pannus bilaterally, lower back, and   right lateral upper thigh. There is also more prominent stranding/inflammation of the   subcutaneous fat in the left lateral abdominal and flank regions (e.g. on CT images 134-*****).   This is new from prior study, and may reflect interval trauma to this region.    There are chronic degenerative changes of the skeleton, with stable mild spinal scoliosis.   There is a persistent indwelling right hip prosthesis. There are persistent post-surgical   changes within the lower lumbar spine and left humeral head, as well as probable post-surgical   changes of the right posterior ilium (e.g. a bone graft donor site). There are probable   old/healed rib injuries (e.g. within the right posterior ribcage), as well as probable new   traumatic injury/fracture of the left 12th rib (SUV 3.7). Prior activity near the left   posterior acetabulum/ischium has resolved. A prior discrete focus of hypermetabolism within   the right inferior L5 vertebra (near the right lumbosacral junction) has also resolved, as has   prior hypermetabolism within the left posterior third rib and right posterior 
 ninth rib. These   prior findings were equivocal, with limited, treated/resolved (by metabolism) skeletal   metastatic disease not entirely excluded. However, there is currently felt to be no definitive   metabolic evidence of active skeletal metastatic disease.    For reference/comparison purposes, blood pool activity within the descending thoracic aorta (at   the level of the carina) demonstrates an approximate SUV of 2.0 currently and 2.2 previously.

There are probable   old/healed rib injuries (e.g. within the right posterior ribcage), as well as probable new   traumatic injury/fracture of the left 12th rib (SUV 3.7).  Prior activity near the left   posterior acetabulum/ischium has resolved.  A prior discrete focus of hypermetabolism within   the right inferior L5 vertebra (near the right lumbosacral junction) has also resolved, as has   prior hypermetabolism within the left posterior third rib and right posterior ninth rib.  These   prior findings were equivocal, with limited, treated/resolved (by metabolism) skeletal   metastatic disease not entirely excluded.  
 However, there is currently felt to be no definitive   metabolic evidence of active skeletal metastatic disease.    For reference/comparison purposes, blood pool activity within the descending thoracic aorta (at   the level of the carina) demonstrates an approximate SUV of 2.0 currently and 2.2 previously.      IMPRESSION:    1.  Relatively stable faintly hypermetabolic nodular densities within both breasts, as detailed   above.  The apparent limited FDG avidity of this patient's primary breast cancer limits its   evaluation by this imaging technique.    2.  Prior extensive locoregional nodal metastatic disease in the right axillary and right   subpectoral regions has substantially improved with interval therapy.  A few residual   borderline-enlarged, faintly hypermetabolic lymph nodes in these areas suggest potential   limited residual nodal metastatic disease.    3.  New probable inflammatory changes within the left lateral abdominal wall/flank soft   tissues, with a new probable injury/fracture of the left 12th rib.  There are probable   superimposed old/healed rib injuries.  A few other equivocal skeletal finding seen previously   have resolved (metabolically), with limited treated/resolved skeletal metastatic disease not   entirely excluded.    4.  Probable combination of scars/granulomas and atelectatic changes within the lungs, as   detailed above.    5.  Other likely-benign findings, as detailed above.

We had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her daughter which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. First, we reviewed *****'s pathology confirming that she has metastatic breast cancer which is estrogen receptor positive 
 and ***** negative based on core needle biopsy of an axillary LN in November 2019. She presented with extensive lytic bone lesions at that time. She has since developed metastatic disease to the liver and pachymeninges and possibly to the leptomeninges, although her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells. We explained that metastatic breast cancer is not curable, but it is treatable and there are therapies that will extend the quality and duration of life.     We reviewed her treatment course to date. She was initially started on letrozole/palbociclib in December 2019, but this was discontinued due to PD to the liver and LN in July 2020. WE assured ***** that this was an appropriate treatment choice as initial therapy of *****+/*****- metastatic disease. Upon progression, she was switched to Xeloda (initially 500mg BID inadvertantly, then 1000mg BID in mid-September, and 1500 mg BID since late September).     She recently had brain MRIs on 09/29/20 and again on 11/07/20, which showed diffuse irregular ***** enhancement along the bilateral cerebral convexities and right petroclival region as well as *****'s ***** The more recent scan showed possibly worsening of disease in the internal auditory canal, which would be consistent with her recent right hearing loss.  We tried to explain to the patient and family the difference between ***** based/***** disease and leptomeningeal disease and stressed that it can be very difficulty radiographically to distinguish the two. While her first CSF cytology was negative for malignant cells, her radiographic and clinical findings raise suspicion for leptomeningeal disease.    Recently, her neurologic symptoms are getting progressively worse, with no improvement in her vision and now auditory symptoms. Despite her initial CSF cytology being negative, we explained that  false negatives are not uncommon and we recommend repeat LP with cytology now. We also recommend referral to 
 radiation oncology for consideration of radiation therapy (either just to her internal auditory canal or to a larger portion of her *****). We would also consider starting low dose steroids to see if this improves her symptoms.     In terms of future options, if a CT CAP shows clear progression on Xeloda, we would consider another hormone-based therapy strategy. We would consider fulvestrant plus the ***** inhibitor ***** (*****) (***** ***** 2019), given her known ***** mutation on Strata testing. In this study, in the cohort of patients with *****-mutated cancer, progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 20 months was 11.0 months in the *****-fulvestrant group, as compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group. However, this regimen does not have great CNS penetration, but there are few regimens that do.    Given that she has metastatic disease to the bone, we agree with continuing zolendronic acid    Recommendations:  -- Repeat CT CAP now  -- Repeat LP for CSF cytology  -- Repeat MRI spine to r/o LMD in the spine  -- Recommend referral to radiation oncology to consider either focal CNS radiation or possible even *****. The patient is interested in a UCSF Rad Onc opinion as well.  -- Could consider starting low dose steroids to see if reduction of swelling improves any of her symptoms  -- Continue xeloda 1500mg BID for now  -- At time of progression of disease, could consider fulvestrant + ***** given the ***** mutation on STRATA testing  -- Continue zolendronic acid    Patient seen and discussed with breast oncology attending *****. ***** *****.    ***** *****, MD PGY-5  Hematology/Oncology Fellow

A long discussion with Ms. ***** about the general approach to the treatment of primary breast cancer with the use of surgery and radiation to remove the tumor from the chest wall and prevent its recurrence locally as well as the use of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy as systemic therapy peak to prevent distant metastatic recurrence.given the tumor parameters mentioned above I assessed th at she had a reasonably high risk of breast cancer recurrence in the range of about 40-45%.I discussed the process of risk estimation with her and the various parameters that we use to assess  risk she seemed to understand as well.  Ms. ***** that it would be very reasonable to pursue a course of hormonal therapy to decrease the risk of metastatic recurrence and that the risk-benefit ratio for hormonal treatment would be favorable. Although I believe there would be some benefit from a course of chemotherapy in this case I believe her age (even though she appears vigorous for her stated age) and her history of Parkinson's disease would make the risk benefit ratio for a course of chemotherapy less favorable.  Since a course of chemotherapy added to a course of hormonal therapy only give her an additional benefit of 3-4% I suggested I could not strongly recommend a course of chemotherapy that would be a personal decision will depend on how aggressively she wanted to approach his situation with Ms. ***** told me that she was leaning against the course of chemotherapy and would prefer to receive a course of hormonal therapy alone and I to initiate therapy could support her in that decision.

We had a lengthy discussion with the patient in which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. We 
 reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports.     We discussed the use of locoregional therapies to reduce risk of locoregional disease and the use of systemic therapies to primarily reduce risk of systemic recurrence, which can potentially be incurable.     Because she has HR+ disease, she will need at least 5 years of hormonal therapy. Data from *****/TEXT trial demonstrated that patient who were premenopausal at their breast cancer diagnosis and recovered ovarian function after completion of chemotherapy, the combination of ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor was superior to tamoxifen in terms of preventing distant recurrence. However, given the low grade and low proliferation rate of her tumor, we do not believe she will benefit chemotherapy. We discussed that molecular tests such as ***** can be helpful for situations where the decision regarding chemotherapy may not be as clear. She is interested in her ***** score and we will order. In the meantime she can proceed with radiation consult and sim, not to start xrt until after ***** result comes back.    Given she is pre-menopausal, and has a low grade/low proliferation tumor, we would recommend she start with tamoxifen after completion of adjuvant radiation. If her ***** test is in the higher end of intermediate we can discuss the potential benefit of *****/*****, otherwise tamoxifen will likely be sufficient.     We discussed the importance of exercise - at least 150min of aerobic exercises per week, weight bearing exercises at least 2x a week, and to reduce alcohol and sugar/***** intake.       Plan  - ***** send for ***** testing  - Proceed with adjuvant radiation consult, wait to start xrt until after ***** comes back.  - Tamoxifen after completion of adjuvant radiation       RTC after radiation to discuss hormone therapy in greater detail.

98,Female,White,1963-02-15,"HPI:  ***** ***** is a 49 y.o. female with a history of a left-sided breast cancer diagnosed in 2009 who was recently diagnosed with metastatic disease.  The patient's breast cancer history began in early 2009 when she was diagnosed with a locally advanced left-sided breast cancer.  She underwent a left modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection on 08/12/2008.  The pathology revealed a 2.6 cm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma.  There was also ductal carcinoma in situ, and lymphovascular invasion was present.  August 25 lymph nodes were involved with metastatic carcinoma, with the largest metastatic deposit measuring 1.6 cm, and presence of extracapsular extension.  According to the notes provided by the referring physician, the invasive cancer was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive, and HER-2/neu negative.  The patient completed 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 4 cycles of Taxol given in a dose dense fashion in December 2008.  The patient completed chest wall radiation in February 2009 and then initiated tamoxifen in March 2009.  Menses stopped during chemo and then came back briefly, and then stopped completely after about 6 months of tamoxifen.     The patient underwent a prophylactic right mastectomy on 07/09/2010.  Pathology incidentally found a 0.6 cm invasive ductal carcinoma which was estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and HER-2/neu 3+ by immunohistochemistry.  There was also associated ductal carcinoma in situ.  The patient decided against an axillary lymph node dissection.  She underwent a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on 08/03/2010 which did not reveal any evidence of distant metastatic disease. She was treated with adjuvant Taxol and trastuzumab given weekly for 12 weeks between 09/22/2010 through 12/22/2010.  She experienced a drop in ***** and Herceptin was discontinued after a total of 12 
 weeks. According to the notes provided by the referring physician, the patient tolerated this treatment poorly.  The patient has been followed by a cardiologist and was started on Coreg. Her EF improved from 50% up to 60%. Coreg was discontinued after 6 months, and her last EF by ***** was 56%. She is due for a follow up *****. In terms of hormonal therapies, the patient continued on Tamoxifen until May 2012. She then switched to anastrozole, and experienced joint pains so she was switched to letrozole.     In terms of recent symptoms, the patient underwent a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on 12/14/2011 for evaluation of intense abdominal pain and diarrhea. She was diagnosed with diverticulitis and was given antibiotics.The patient reports having left chest wall pain both internally and externally starting about 6 months ago. She brought this to the attention of her oncologist and she underwent a PET CT scan on 06/09/2012 which revealed a new left lung mass as well as mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  According to the notes from the referring physician, her case was discussed at the ***** multidisciplinary tumor board and a biopsy of the left lung mass was recommended.  According to the notes provided by her prior oncologist, the patient apparently declined the biopsy, either CT-guided or surgical, and proceeded with treatment with fulvestrant. The patient reports that she considered the biopsy but was in the process of trying to transfer care to UCSF. She states that she intended to have the biopsy performed, but would prefer to have it done at *****.  Since that time, the patient experienced an episode of chest pain in late July and was seen by several MDs. She was prescribed an anti-inflammatory patch which did not help. She then saw her cardiologist who did not think it was cardiac in nature.     The patient that underwent a followup PET/CT scan performed at the ***** facility in *****, ***** on August 20, 
 2013.  This scan revealed an interval decrease in the mediastinal lymphadenopathy since the prior exam with an enlarged AP window node measuring 11 mm as compared to the prior measurement of 15 mm in short axis.  However there was a new AP window lymph node with market hypermetabolic activity.  Additionally the mass within the lingula of the lung measured 3.4 x 2.2 cm as compared to the prior measurement of 2.9 x 2 cm.  Within the abdomen and pelvis, heterogeneous uptake was noted with defects in the liver suggestive of cysts.  The scan also revealed diverticulosis with no findings of diverticulitis.  There was a ***** defect within the right adnexa likely representing an ovarian cyst.  There was heterogeneous bone marrow uptake noted with no hypermetabolic activity to suggest metastatic disease.    The patient now presents to UCSF for ongoing treatment recommendations and would like to proceed with the biopsy of the lung lesion. She reports having continued chest pain, similar to that which she experienced in July. She reports having a high pain tolerance but at times this pain is the worst she has ever experienced. She denies any fevers or chills. She has no nausea or vomiting, significant cough or dyspnea associated with the chest pain. She is accompanied today by her father who seems extremely supportive. The patient is an excellent historian and record *****, and is adamant to clarify any discrepancies and ***** in the medical record provided by *****.

The patient was then diagnosed with metastatic disease in June 2012 based on imaging findings including mediastinal adenopathy and a left lung mass.  The patient has not 
 had a pathologic diagnosis of metastatic disease, but was instead started on treatment in the form of fulvestrant.  A followup scan in August 2012 showed increase in size of the lung lesion but modest decrease in the size of the mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Based on the increasing chest pain being experienced by the patient, I am highly suspicious that the lung lesion is progressing further, and the subpleural thickening in the anterior left lower lobe likely represents progression of disease as well.  At this point, in order to make the most appropriate treatment recommendations, I fully agree with the ***** medical oncology group that the patient needs to have a biopsy of either the pulmonary nodule, mediastinal adenopathy, or the area of subpleural thickening that might represent another site of metastatic disease.  I explained to the patient that I do not know what is the ***** approach to biopsy one or more of these lesions, and that we will need a followup CT scan which has contrast and thin slices in order to better understand the extent of disease, since the CT scan from 08/18/2012 was noncontrast and used for anatomic localization only.  In the meantime, I have submitted a referral to both interventional radiology as well as thoracic surgery to determine what is the best route for biopsy of her disease.    The patient understands that I cannot make a comprehensive treatment recommendation until I know the biological characteristics of her metastatic disease.  If her cancer remains estrogen receptor positive, it would be reasonable to consider ongoing hormonal therapy, but most likely combined with a biological therapy such as the combination of Exemestane and Afinitor. We would also entertain the possibility of a chemotherapy such as Xeloda which could have reasonable efficacy as well as allow the patient to maintain a decent quality of life. Alternatively, if the metastatic disease is hormone receptor 
 negative, we will need to switch to chemotherapy to control her disease.  We will also discuss a variety of clinical trials combining combinations of chemotherapy with biological therapy.    In terms of symptom management, recent episodes of chest pain have been extremely intense for the patient, and she certainly needs a comprehensive review of pain management strategies.  I have placed a referral to our symptom management service so that they can focused their attention entirely on symptom management while I sort out what is the best treatment for her metastatic cancer. He will return to clinic in approximately 2 weeks, and hopefully by that time she will have had the chest CT, seen the thoracic surgeon, and her need by interventional radiology.    Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects, exercise, and nutrition reviewed in detail.

100,Male,Asian,1948-05-20,"Mr. ***** is a 73 y.o. male who comes to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in follow up for his recently diagnosed pancreatic adenocarcinoma.. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all his outside records.    History of Present Illness, reviewed:  This pleasant gentleman, previously quite healthy overall, originally presented to St. *****'s Hospital on 02/04/22 with the subacute onset of painless jaundice and orange urine developing over the preceding week. Initial CT abdomen (02/04/2022) was suspicious for a pancreatic head mass versus an enlarged lymph node along the portacaval region measuring at least 4.5 x 1.8 cm, with associated moderate extrahepatic duct dilatation. He was admitted to expedite work-up which to date has included:     - Bloodwork on 02/05/22 significant for ALT 972, AST 478, total bilirubin 11.2  - 02/05/22: Repeat CT A/P showed a lobulated mass at the pancreatic head, with either extension of the mass or an enlarged lymph node in the portacaval region. Obstruction of the extrahepatic bile duct was noted at the level of the pancreatic mass with moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation was also seen.   - 02/10/22: EUS: Irregular hypoechoic mass was identified in the pancreatic head measuring 35 mm by 30 mm with well-defined endosonographic borders. An intact interface was seen between the mass and the adjacent structures suggesting a lack of invasion. One enlarged lymph node was visualized in the aortocaval region as well measuring 40 mm by 15 mm in maximal cross-sectional diameter. Findings consistent with ***** disease. Pathology from the FNA demonstrated moderately differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma. ERCP also performed, with placement of a covered metal stent.  - 02/19/22: Baseline *****-9 markedly elevated at 77,736 (in the context of obstructive jaundice)    Following consultation with both myself and Dr. ***** from our 
 Surgical Oncology faculty, we recommended a neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategy followed by ***** his surgical prospects. He initiated ***** on 03/06/2022, once his LFTs had sufficiently normalized post-stent, and is now s/p 3 cycles of treatment.    The patient's present review of systems was reviewed. He continues to tolerate chemotherapy quite well overall; his last cycle in fact was a/w less hiccups, fatigue, and cold sensitivity/peripheral sensory neuropathy than previously. He reports maintenance of a good appetite, and no abdominal pain, diarrhea, fevers or chills. He is staying active, walking and still playing golf.

Based on the original pretreatment study, there is possible abutment of the main portal vein at the portal SMV confluence.   2)  Thrombus in vein:  absent  3)  Venous collateral:  absent    Liver: No suspicious lesions. Metallic biliary stent in place with expected pneumobilia.    Peritoneal or omental nodules:  None    Ascites: absent    Lymph nodes:  Compared to 02/05/2022, interval near resolution of portal caval nodes, now with some mild fat stranding in that area.    Spleen: Unremarkable    Adrenal: Unremarkable    Kidney: Bilateral renal cysts measuring up to 2.7 cm punctate 2 mm nonobstructing stone in the right kidney.    GI tract: Unremarkable    Visualized lung bases:  Small 6 mm nodular opacity in the right lung base (SE 7, image 15) is slightly more conspicuous than on prior and may be infectious/inflammatory.    Bones:  No suspicious lesions    Extraperitoneal 
 soft tissues: Unremarkable    Lines/drains/medical devices: As above    IMPRESSION:   1.  Known pancreatic cancer is not discretely visualized on this study. No arterial involvement. Venous involvement is difficult to assess given nonvisualization of the tumor.  2.  Previously noted enlarged portacaval lymph node has essentially resolved.  3. Small 6 mm nodular opacity in the right lung base is slightly more conspicuous than on prior and may be infectious/inflammatory. Attention on follow up        CT A/P 02/05/22  Findings:   CT Abdomen:   Again demonstrated is moderate dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts and dilated extrahepatic bile duct measuring up to 1.5 cm, abrupt ***** at the upper margin of the pancreatic head.  Immediately below the site of the biliary ductal obstruction, there is a lobulated area of tissue which demonstrates relative decreased enhancement compared to the remainder of the pancreas on the arterial phase, and measures approximately 4.5 x 2 cm in transverse dimension and 2.6 cm in superior-inferior dimension.  There is either an extension of this mass into the portacaval space or a portacaval lymph node measuring approximately 2.1 x 1.1 cm in transverse dimension and 1.1 cm in superior-inferior dimension.     There is no atrophy of the pancreatic parenchyma or dilatation of the pancreatic duct.  There is no evidence of prominent encasement of the superior mesenteric vasculature.  No focal parenchymal lesions of the liver are distinctly demonstrated.  The gallbladder is partially contracted and contains small radiopaque stones.  There are small calcific attenuation foci near the neck of the gallbladder and in the region of the cystic duct which may be small stones.  No radiopaque stones are distinctly demonstrated within the extrahepatic bile duct.     Visible lower thorax does not show pulmonary consolidation or pleural effusions.   Spleen is not enlarged.   Kidneys show 
 nonobstructive small right renal calculi and small cortical cysts.   Adrenal glands do not demonstrate any mass lesions.   Stomach is not distended.   The bowel does not show evidence of obstruction or acute inflammatory disease.  There is prominent fecal material mildly distending the rectum.   The abdominal nodes are not enlarged.   The aorta is not aneurysmal.     CT Pelvis:   The partially filled urinary bladder demonstrates mildly prominent mural contours.   No free fluid or adenopathy within the pelvis.     Impression:   1.  Again demonstrated is a lobulated mass at the head of the pancreas, with either extension of the mass or an enlarged lymph node in the portacaval region.     2.  Obstruction of the extrahepatic bile duct at the level of the pancreatic mass with moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.     3.  Cholelithiasis.     4.  Right nephrolithiasis.        Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 73 y.o. male with a new diagnosis of potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (with a regional LN), s/p ***** stenting for malignant obstructive jaundice at presentation.     He is now s/p 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with ***** which he is tolerating adequately to date, with a nice recent precipitous drop in his *****-9 measurement. We reviewed his most recent imaging studies which show, quite encouragingly, resolution of his aortocaval LN and a primary pancreatic tumor that is non-assessable, but without clear vascular involvement.    While the optimal selection and duration of systemic therapy, as well as the uncertain role of radiation, in this neoadjuvant context remain uncertain, I would favor a period of up-front chemotherapy for up to 4-6 months, aiming to drive down his *****-9 levels to as close to normal range as possible, before re-addressing his surgical candidacy (noting the markedly elevated *****-9 at baseline, highly concerning for 
 micrometastatic disease). This approach in our institutional experience has led to successful cytoreduction and good radiographic and (sometimes near-complete) pathologic responses.    Laboratory parameters are acceptable to proceed with his next cycle of treatment today (#5) at unchanged full doses. We will plan on re-imaging again after 4 more cycles for formal tumor re-evaluation.    Other issues:  - Germline testing = negative for any hereditary pathogenic mutations  - Still awaiting original tumor biopsy specimen; if there is adequate cellularity, we will send for molecular testing (via Foundation One) to assess for the presence of any actionable mutations or other genetic alterations that may inform future treatment options either on- or off-study.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his and his family's satisfaction.         Medical decision-making:  Problems: His active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High.

101,Female,Asian,1945-09-12,"Subjective:    This is a lovely 71-year-old Filipino woman who first presented in February to outside hospital, ***** ***** Center, in February for complaints of abdominal pain. Ultrasound at that time showed a 2.6cm pancreatic tail mass. Follow-up CT abd/pelvis showed two pancreatic lesions, one in the body of the pancreas measuring 1.2x1.8x1.5cm and another in the tail measuring 2.0x2.8x1.6cm. Imaging also showed an enlarged uterus, lobulated and ***** with no discernable endometrial cavity. A CT guided biopsy of pancreatic body lesion on 04/04/2015 was unsuccessful however FAN performed on 04/10/2015 was revealing for ***** c/w mucinous cystic neoplasm vs intraductal papillary mucinous tumor. Pt had evaluation by GI Surgery, Dr. *****, on 05/26/15 with repeat scans that day again demonstrating 2.5x1.5cm pancreatic tail mass, size stable from imaging several months prior, with no evidence of invasion into nearby structures. Uterine mass seen was 13.6 cm and felt to be concerning for leiomyosarcoma. Pt had staging with PET scan shortly thereafter on 05/30/15 with no evidence of metastatic disease. Pt had ***** of 1.***** ***** *****-9 of 30. On 06/24/15 patient underwent synchronous *****-BSO and ***** abdominal distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. ***** from the pancreatic mass was consistent with pT3N1 poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Only 1 of 38 LN sampled with positive. Uterine mass ***** was noted to be unusual smooth muscle ***** tumor. Pt had an unremarkable post-operative recovery.    We initially offered her a spot on the ***** trial but she was not eligible because of an elevated CA-19-9. She then started therapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine and has completed six full cycles.    She's been on surveillance. She comes back today for follow-up with a CT scan.    She feels good.

102,Female,Unknown/Declined,1960-09-29,"Subjective:    This is a very pleasant 52-year-old woman with a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma.  She began having complaints of pain in June 2012.  An abdominal CT scan done in July was unremarkable but a followup CT scan in November showed numerous low-density lesions in the abdomen, low-density mass in the body of the pancreas and a mass in the uncinate process.  Biopsy of a retroperitoneal lymph node was positive for adenocarcinoma.    As part of her workup, she did have a colonoscopy in October which revealed a constricting but not obstructing colonic mass in the ascending colon.  This was also biopsied and felt to be consistent with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  The imaging studies in May also suggested that the portal vein, superior mesenteric and splenic regions are opacified.  There was a mass lesion pressing on the right renal vein.  There were multiple mesenteric implants. The tissue was reviewed here at ***** and the findings were consistent with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tissue was also noted to be microsatellite stable.    We started her on *****.  After completing her first cycle, she was hospitalized for diarrhea and was found to have C. Difficile infection.  She completed a course of vancomycin on November 19.    Since starting treatment, her severe pain has completely abated and she is no longer taking any narcotics.  Her appetite is excellent.  She has a good energy level.  She does note that she has a crampy bowel movement after eating and he is having up to 8 stools a day.    She has been able to quit smoking.

103,Male,Asian,1959-08-23,"VIDEO VISIT  I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.      Mr. ***** is a 61 y.o. male whom I am seeing as a video visit at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.    History of Present Illness, reviewed:  This pleasant gentleman initially presented to medical attention in December 2019 with urinary urge incontinence (urinalysis negative), with associated suprapubic discomfort. He also endorsed weight loss of 10 pounds since June, ***** with the beginning of the *****-19 pandemic, but otherwise no fever or infectious symptoms. Ultimately, as his symptoms progressed, he underwent a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis (01/24/20) that demonstrated a 3.5 cm pancreatic tail mass with occlusion of the splenic vein and encasement of the splenic artery with resultant upper abdominal collaterals. Possible abutment of the mass on the stomach and left adrenal gland was seen. Additionally, there was multifocal hepatic metastatic disease with resultant mild right intrahepatic biliary dilatation, as well as diffuse circumferential rectosigmoid wall thickening, possibly representing proctitis for which he received a 2 week course of Septra -> ciprofloxacin which provided mild pain relief. Laboratory studies (02/09/2020) showed his liver enzymes to be moderately elevated, with ALT 114 and AST 71, and his CA 19-9 to be markedly abnormal at 19,362 U/mL.    He eventually underwent a CT guided liver biopsy on 02/29/20, and pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin. He also subsequently was found to have cytologically-confirmed peritoneal carcinomatosis, 
 with (+) metastatic adenocarcinoma in his ascitic fluid (paracentesis 06/07/2020).    He initiated chemotherapy with ***** on 03/20/2020 and received a total of 6 cycles through 06/05/2020, requiring dose reductions (irinotecan 90 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 68 mg/m2) by the end. His disease course has been notable for recurrent large bowel obstruction, initially treated with colonic stent placement back in April; then, with recurrent symptoms last month, requiring a prolonged hospital admission at ***** campus from June 14 - 07/19/2020. He was managed symptomatically with NGT decompression, octreotide, dexamethasone, and pain management, with the obstruction gradually resolving. He was also rx'ed for an MSSA bacteremia with a 4-week course of IV antibiotics. We had a GOC discussion while he was in the hospital, at which time he expressed a desire to remain proactive with further rx if at all possible.    Review of systems  Since discharge from the hospital, Mr. ***** reports:  - Home VNA services once weekly, plus sister is now living with him at his home. Patient himself does require fairly regular assistance with most ADLs and with ambulation.  - Pain management consists of Fentanyl patch plus Dilaudid for breakthrough; fair control (better at night than during the daytime).  - Tolerating some solid POs, with occasional postprandial nausea/vomiting.  - (+) passing flatus and semi-solid BMs  - No recent fevers     Current Outpatient Medications   Medication Instructions    acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 1,000 mg, Oral, Every 8 Hours    apixaban (ELIQUIS) 5 mg, Oral, 2 Times Daily Scheduled    bisacodyL (DULCOLAX) 10 mg, Rectal, Daily PRN    dexAMETHasone (DECADRON) 4 mg, Oral, 2 times daily    [START ***** 08/17/2020] fentaNYL (DURAGESIC) 12 mcg/hr patch 1 patch, Transdermal, Every 72 Hours    HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) 2-4 mg, Oral, Every 3 Hours PRN    LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg, Oral, Daily PRN    metoclopramide HCl (REGLAN)

Pancreas:  Similar ill-defined pancreatic tail mass as described in the index lesions. Adrenal Glands:  Similar abutment of the pancreatic mass to the left adrenal gland. Kidneys:  Unremarkable GI Tract:  Nasogastric tube along the gastric body. Improving mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel wall edema throughout the colon with residual thickening seen at the sigmoid colon. No evidence for bowel obstruction. Similar outpouching along the gastric antrum with associated wall thickening which may represent a gastric ulceration. Vasculature:  Moderate atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and its branches. Chronically occluded splenic vein with perisplenic and perigastric varices. Lymphadenopathy: Absent Peritoneum: Slightly worse large volume ascites. Similar peritoneal implants involving the omentum and bowel serosa as described in the index lesions.

Ill-defined ***** lesions within the spleen may represent splenic metastases versus infarcts. 5.  Peritoneal carcinomatosis with slightly worse large volume ascites and similar peritoneal implants.         Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 61 y.o. male with metastatic pancreatic cancer, s/p front-line rx with ***** x 6 cycles but with evidence of 
 radiographic/clinical disease progression including recurrent bowel obstruction as detailed above. He has just recently been d/c'ed from the hospital following a prolonged admission for obstruction, pain, and bacteremia.    We again had a GOC discussion, as I expressed concerns re: the risk:benefit ratio of any further salvage treatment and why he may instead wish to refocus his goals on purely palliative/symptomatic measures with a transition to hospice, given that his expected longevity is likely measurable in weeks to a few months at best (if he chooses this path, he indicated a desire for an inpatient facility rather than home hospice). He understands why the mainstay of any treatment at this point would center on systemic therapy (i.e. a gemcitabine-based regimen -- in case, no more than gemcitabine monotherapy), and we talked about potential side fx and risks, esp in terms of infectious complications, and adverse impact on his *****.    Of note, molecular profiling results of his tumor show mutations in *****, *****, *****, SMAD4, and ATR; as well as microsatellite stability. Regardless, in his overall condition and w/his recurrent bowel obstruction, I do not think he would be an appropriate clinical trial candidate for any of our early phase studies.    Symptom-wise, he is followed by our Cancer Center Symptom Management Service; his pain appears reasonably managed right now with a combination of long- and short acting opioid analgesics. He does not appear to be frankly obstructed.     Mr. ***** will take some time to decide whether he wishes to pursue further salvage rx vs a purely palliative route, and will let us know once he comes to a final decision.        Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring 
 for potential major/life-threatening toxicities.

104,Female,Black or African American,1952-07-31,"VIDEO VISIT  I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including ***** live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.      Ms. ***** is ***** 69 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her ***** cancer, now with evidence of widely metastatic disease.    History of Present Illness, reviewed:  The ***** presented to care in December 2016 after developing ***** symptoms; laboratory studies were notable for ***** total bilirubin of 4.6 and Hct of 20.3. An ERCP on 01/18/17showed ***** ulcerated mass at the major papilla with stricturing of the distal bile duct, through which ***** metallic ***** stent was placed. EUS at that same time showed an irregular mass at the ampulla that was poorly defined with no arterial invasion seen, but sonographic evidence suggesting invasion of this mass into the bile duct (intraluminal growth). No ***** was seen. Portal vein and SMV were intact and uninvolved and ***** tortuous pancreatic duct was noted. FNA of the mass *****/w well differentiated adenocarcinoma. After decompression with stent, ***** to 0.8. Staging CT-PET scan was performed 02/24/17 and showed FDG uptake w/i the region of ampulla w/SUV *****.5. No FDG avid lymphadenopathy or more distant metastatic disease *****.     There was then ***** gap in the patient's medical care (pertaining to further evaluation of her ampullary carcinoma) over the next several months, due in part ***** ***** the patient sustained at her daughter's home in ***** ***** in February, possibly related to dizziness and unsteady gait; at that time ***** hospitalized at ***** for 
 workup,***** MRI which showed chronic lacunar infarcts.     ***** ultimately seen here at ***** ***** *****. ***** ***** (Surg Onc) on 05/23/2017. ***** pancreas protocol CT was performed showing ***** 2cm ampullary mass without vascular involvement, nodal or metastatic disease. While her ***** therefore felt to be technically resectable, the patient'sco-morbidities including poorly controlled asthma, ongoing EtOH consumption,and treated Hep C, all raised concerns re: her potential operative morbidity. On this basis she was referred to the Surgical Wellness program and evaluated by our Pulmonary and Cardiology services ***** optimize her standing medical problems.    Intervally, she was admitted on 05/30/17 with concern for ***** ***** bleed after she experienced several melanotic stools. On admission Hct was found to 19.9 though she was hemodynamically stable. Following transfusion she underwent repeat ERCP on 06/02/17 which revealed ***** oozing ulceration around the duodenum which was coagulated. Her previously placed biliary stent was identified but not exchanged.     She was ultimately taken for pylorus-preserving ***** Dr. ***** on 08/14/2017, with pathology showing:  ---------------------------  Procedure: Pancreaticoduodenectomy.  Location: Ampullary, NOS.  Size: 3.8 cm in greatest dimension.  Histologic type: Adenocarcinoma, intestinal type.   Macroscopic tumor perforation: Not identified.  Grade: Well differentiated.  Depth of invasion: Tumor invades into duodenal muscularis propria (pT2).  Lymphovascular invasion: Not identified.  Perineural invasion: Not identified.  Margins:    - Proximal margin: Negative (tumor is 2.8 cm from margin).   - Distal margin: Negative (tumor is 19 cm from margin).   - Pancreatic parenchymal margin: Negative (tumor is 3.2 cm from  margin).   - Uncinate (retroperitoneal) margin: Negative (tumor is 2.5 cm from  margin).   - Bile duct 
 margin: Negative (tumor is 4.7 cm from margin).  Lymph node status: Positive.   - Total number of positive nodes: 4.   - Total number of nodes examined: 18.      Additional pathologic findings: None.  AJCC Pathologic stage: ***** (AJCC 8th edition)  MMR proteins all intact by IHC.  -----------------------------  Her postoperative course was notable for an anastomotic leak requiring ex-lap on 08/24/2017 with abdominal washout. She subsequently developed ***** ***** fistula managed with TPN/NPO/PTBD, with GJ later placed for tube feeding. She was ultimately d/c'ed on 09/30/2017 to ***** long-term assisted living facility for ***** *****/*****/*****.After considering the risk/benefit balance of adjuvant chemotherapy, we opted not to pursue treatment and to proceed with ***** careful of close monitoring/surveillance instead. I last saw her in ***** ***** clinic back in January 2018, after which time she was lost to f/u for ***** period of time.    In February 2019 she was admitted to ***** for an upper GI bleed (Hgb 5 on admission), for which she was tx'ed with 3u PRBC and underwent EGD showing multiple anastomotic ulcers, clean based, in the stomach, a/w mild/moderate gastritis. She was started on PPI rx and her NSAIDs and rivaroxaban (which she had been on for ***** subsegmental PE diagnosed back in September 2017) were discontinued. CT scans during that hospital admission were notable for postoperative changes, hepatic steatosis, and mild nonspecific mesenteric and retroperitoneal adenopathy.    F/u CT scans in September 2019 showed new enlarging retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes up to 2-plus cm in size, as well as bilateral pulmonary lesions up to 1.2 cm in size, concerning for metastatic disease. It does not appear that she had any f/u for this.    More recently, she presented to the UCSF ED on 04/07/2020 with N/V and diarrhea and several syncopal episodes. Repeat imaging performed at that 
 time (CT scans 04/08/2020) showed further disease progression in lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. Liver biopsy the following day confirmed adenocarcinoma    After extensive discussions w/Ms. ***** and her family re: her prognosis and the role and potential toxicities a/w systemic therapy esp in light of her challenging social circumstances (including ongoing heavy EtOH consumption), she ultimately initiated chemotherapy with empirically dose-reduced ***** beginning on 05/26/2020. Repeat CT scans after 4 treatment cycles showed reasonable disease control with only one area of slight growth in the liver (segment 8), but other areas (liver, lung, LNs) stable or slightly decreased in size; furthermore, she appeared to be deriving ***** favorable clinical benefit from treatment. On these bases, she continued with the same ***** regimen, with repeat CT scans after 8 cycles showing, again, only slight increase in ***** single hepatic lesion, this time in segment 2. She has since gone on to complete 11 cycles of chemotherapy in total, most recently on 10/21/2020.    Interval history/review of systems  - Some cumulative treatment-related fatigue  - Abdominal pain fairly well-controlled on stable dose of ***** *****  - Sluggish appetite  - Fairly regular BMs  - Mild non-progressive, non-debilitating peripheral sensory neuropathy  - Splits time between living independently at home and with family  - No SOB, cough, or respiratory symptoms.  - Family indicates she is still smoking and drinking EtOH ***** fair amount each day.

Within those limits, similar size of previously seen metastatic lesions and no new lesions. Index lesions are described as 
 follows:    INDEX LESIONS (Restaging):   *****:  Hepatic segment 8 : 3.5 cm (Se/Im *****/*****), previously 3.5 cm   *****:  Hepatic segment 2 : 1.6 cm (Se/Im *****/*****), previously 1.6 cm   *****:  Mesenteric nodal conglomerate : 1.6 cm (Se/Im *****/*****), previously 1.6 cm     New lesions: None    Gallbladder: Surgically absent.    Biliary: Pneumobilia secondary to choledochojejunostomy.    Spleen:  Unremarkable    Pancreas:  Operative changes of ***** procedure. Remnant pancreatic tissue is unremarkable.     Adrenal Glands:  Unremarkable    Kidneys:  Unremarkable     GI Tract:  Scattered colonic diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis. Mild thickening of the sigmoid colon likely attributable to chronic diverticular disease.    Vasculature:  Moderate atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and its branches.    Lymphadenopathy: Index mesenteric nodal conglomerate as described. No significant change in retroperitoneal lymph nodes.    Peritoneum: No ascites    Bladder: Unremarkable    Reproductive organs: Enlarged myomatous uterus. Left ovarian cyst measuring 3.2 cm.    Bones:  No suspicious lesions    Extraperitoneal soft tissues: Unremarkable    IMPRESSION:   1. Please note that due to progression of hepatic steatosis, evaluation is limited for hepatic metastatic disease. Within this constraint, similar size of hepatic metastatic lesions and mesenteric/retroperitoneal lymph nodes. No new metastatic disease within the abdomen and pelvis.      CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST   FINDINGS:  LUNGS:  Redemonstration of innumerable bilateral pulmonary nodules, many of which have increased in size when compared to the prior study. For reference:    *****  Interval increase in size in ***** 10 mm pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe (series 3 image 6 image 57), previously measuring 8 mm.  *****  Interval increase in size in ***** 10 mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe (series 306 image 102), previously measuring 8 mm.  ***** 
  Interval increase in size in ***** 14 mm subpleural nodule in the left upper lobe (306 image 72), previously measuring 12 mm.    PLEURA:  No pneumothorax or pleural effusions.    MEDIASTINUM:   Similar appearing right hilar lymph node measuring up to 15 mm by short axis. Unchanged periaortic lymph nodes seen adjacent to the descending thoracic aorta.    HEART/***** *****:  Right port with the tip in the cavoatrial junction. The heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion.    BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  No suspicious osseous lesions.    IMPRESSION:   Worsening pulmonary metastatic disease with slight increase in size in the multiple nodules.        Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is ***** 69 y.o. female s/p pylorus-preserving ***** resection back in July 2017 for ***** node-positive ampullary carcinoma (intestinal subtype), with ***** protracted postoperative recovery period due to anastomotic leak/***** fistula. From both ***** timing and ***** risk/benefit balance standpoint, especially given her moderate frailty and risk of further ***** ***** recovery, she was felt not to bean ideal candidate for adjuvant chemotherapy despite her fairly high risk of relapse.     She has since developed evidence of widespread metastatic disease involving liver, lung, and lymph nodes, for which she is now receiving palliative chemotherapy consisting of dose-modified ***** (at empirically reduced doses, including oxaliplatin at 80% and omission of the 5-***** bolus). She has now completed 11 cycles in total, which has achieved essentially stable disease in the liver, and only very slight progression in her multifocal pulmonary metastases.    At this point I would favor building in ***** treatment-free interval for ***** couple of months with careful monitoring, given the diminishing returns and cumulative ***** of ongoing chemotherapy. I would not favor any form of maintenance therapy (e.g 
 capecitabine) in her circumstances.    In the future, when she demonstrates more significant disease progression, we could consider an alternative regimen such as *****, but would need to have ***** goals of care discussion, given the non-curative nature of her illness and the need to carefully weigh the risks/benefits of therapy and to prioritize ***** considerations in the process. Of note, I would not consider her to be an appropriate clinical trial candidate. (***** molecular profiling results from her liver biopsy are notable for pathogenic mutations in *****, *****, *****, *****, ARID2, *****, and *****, none of which are directly actionable or for which we have ***** clinical trial specifically geared toward.)    In the meantime, I encouraged her to follow up with our Cancer Center Symptom Management Service(last seen in August) to help with pain and other aspects of physical and psychosocial management. We again discussed the importance of EtOH (and tobacco) cessation.    All of the patient's questions were answered to her and her family's satisfaction. We will proceed with ***** chemotherapy break for the next couple of months and plan on repeat imaging/bloodwork between *****/*****. They know to contact me before her next scheduled visit should any concerning signs/symptoms arise in the interim.      Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient's active cancer represents ***** life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities.

Patient also with underlying hepatitis B.         Oncologic history:    Patient presented with post-prandial abdominal discomfort, early satiety and emesis in May 2012. CT abdomen obtained on 06/25/12 revealed enlarged pancreatic head measuring 48.7x44.9x46.6mm along with dilatation of the pancreatic duct. SMA artery was not encased but a portacaval lymph node measuring 18.7x5.***** was noted. There was intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation in the liver and CBD dilatation without any focal liver lesions.     An EUS was done on 07/05/12 and showed a mass involving the head of the pancreas measuring 4.5x4.***** which was causing partial obstruction in ***** and abutting the SMV and portal vein. FNA of the pancreatic mass showed grade 2 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (*****-67 proliferation index is 3%) with IHC stains positive for synaptophysin and CGA. Patient also had an OctreoScan on 07/19/12 which showed extensive radiotracer uptake within the pancreatic head mass but no metastatic sites.

July 2012: s/p pylorus preserving ***** procedure with reconstruction of SMV, cholecystectomy and liver biopsy by Dr. ***** at *****. Pathology(+) 5.5cm well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, grade 1 (ki-67% <2%) with lymphovascular and perineural invasion. May 42 lymph nodes were involved with metastatic disease. The liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis B, fibrosis grade 0 and multifocal ***** hepatocellular necrosis.     The post-operative course was complicated 
 by ascites for which he received furosemide and spironolactone. He was on the furosemide and spironolactone for 3-4 weeks. lost 30 lbs perioperatively.     08/30/13: CT chest wo contrast showed stable appearance of the chest without pulmonary nodules or lymphadenopathy and an ovoid soft tissue density is seen just inferior to the pancreas on the last ***** of the chest CT.    11/23/2012: Restaging MRI AP showed multiple enhancing lesions in the liver with the largest in the right lobe liver measuring up to 10 mm on the arterial phase. The arterial phase imaging was somewhat limited due to portal venous contamination. An attempted ultrasound guided biopsy of the liver lesion seen on the 11/23/2012 MRI but the ultrasound failed to reveal any nodules in the liver that warranted biopsy. A followup triphasic liver CT also did not visualized on the hypervascular lesion seen on the November 24 MRI.     03/04/2013: Restaging MRI AP showed multiple small foci of persistent arterial phase enhancement within the liver, the largest of which measures 1.5 cm that is better seen on the current MRI. There is a 10 mm nodule at the posterior right hepatic lobe is not well appreciated on current exam. The remainder of the nodules appear stable.     08/30/2013: Restaging MRI AP showed decrease in number of enhancing foci in the liver. Restaging chest CT showed no ***** in the chest.    03/10/2014: Restaging MRI AP showed multiple small arterially enhancing liver lesions are again seen, the largest measuring 1.6 cm in the lateral aspect of the right hepatic lobe. A few of these lesions are seen to enhance more prominently on the current study compared to the prior study of 08/30/2013. However, the lesions were even more intensely enhancing and apparently larger on the more remote study of 03/04/2013. It remains unclear if these variations in lesion conspicuity and size are related to fluctuations of true pathology versus differential 
 visualization due to technical factors such as contrast bolus timing.    09/05/2014: Restaging MRI AP showed stable multiple hypervascular enhancing foci in the liver, the largest 1.7 cm in the lateral right lobe. A single focus of hypervascularity in the posterior inferior right hepatic lobe is slightly more prominent than on exam of 03/10/2014. This may be related to timing of imaging and contrast administration rather than a true increase.    06/22/2015: Restaging MRI abdomen showed increase in size and number of foci of abnormal arterial enhancement in the liver concerning for progressive metastatic cancer.    06/26/15: Dr ***** (*****) recommended -- systemic therapy such as lanreotide, targeted therapy (***** and *****) and chemotherapy. Liver-directed therapy include yttrium-90 radioembolization and/or  right liver lobe resection    07/07/15: Octreoscan showed Intense increased uptake in the region of the pancreatic head (size approximately the same as the abdominal aorta).

PATHOLOGY:     Surgical Pathology 07/28/2015  FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS Review of slides from El ***** Hospital, ***** *****, *****: *****-*****, 07/05/12 Pancreas, fine needle aspiration: Neuroendocrine tumor, see comment. *****-*****, 07/10/15 Retroperitoneal ""lymph node,"" biopsy: Neuroendocrine tumor, see comment. COMMENT: Thank you for the opportunity to review this case. We agree with the original pathologist's diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor. The pancreatic FNA (*****-*****) shows ***** small 
 to intermediate sized cells with minimal pleomorphism, ample cytoplasm, round to ovoid nuclei, and speckled chromatin. Mitotic count is less than one per 10 *****. There is no necrosis. Immunohistochemical stains performed at the original institution and submitted for our review are interpreted as follows in the tumor cells: - Synaptophysin: Positive. - *****-67 Cannot evaluate (H&E section not submitted for comparison, by report 3%). H&E sections from the retroperitoneal lymph node (*****-*****) shows an infiltrating tumor in a background of fibrovascular tissue. The tumor is composed of trabeculae of intermediate sized cells with occasional ***** formation. The tumor cells show mild atypia, ample cytoplasm, round to ovoid nuclei, and conspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic count is at most 3 per 10 high power fields. There is no necrosis. No prominent nucleoli are seen to suggest a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The amount of cytoplasm argues against a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma    Immunohistochemical stains performed at the original institution and reviewed at ***** show the following results in tumor cells:   - Synaptophysin: Positive.  - *****-67: 19.7 % proliferation index (on 2000 cell count).     Overall, the clinical, morphologic and immunohistochemical findings indicate neuroendocrine tumor of pancreatic origin with a possible metastasis to a lymph node (although admittedly no normal nodal tissue is identified in the retroperitoneal biopsy). Based on a pancreatic primary, with 3 mitoses / 10 hpf, a proliferation index = 19.7%, this would be classified as a WHO grade 2 neuroendocrine tumor.

Patient now on lanreotide, which seems like reasonable first step.    He is seeing surg onc today-- but lanreotide likely best step for now.  I want to make sure he doesn't have resectable disease.Future options include liver directed therapy, everolimus, sunitinib or chemotherapy. According to NCCN guidelines, the treatment recommendations for PNET depending on extent of disease, rate of growth (e.g. stable or progressing), and whether or not the patient is symptomatic (bulky disease associated with pain and/or hormone-mediated symptoms. Numerous options may be considered, including chemotherapy, targeted agents, clinical trials, ***** and liver-directed approaches (including cytoreductive surgery and hepatic arterial embolization). Unfortunately, randomized trials are generally *****, thus limiting our ability to identify the optimal sequence of treatment.    Recent phase III data confirm that everolimus (4.6 vs 11 months; *****, et al. *****, 2011) and sunitinib (5.5 vs 11.4 mo; ***** et al. ***** 2011) delay progression when delivered as single agents in patients with radiologic progression. Radiographic responses are rare with either agent (e.g. <10%), but a five month improvement in time to progression was noted in both trials compared to placebo. Treatment with systemic chemotherapy has yield variable results. Streptozocin-based chemotherapy was long considered standard and is FDA approved for this indication. The response rate is variable (as low as 6% in some studies),and this must be considered when weighing the relative merits and *****. *****, et al. reported a 39% RR in a retrospective series of patients with PNET, and this is the regimen we typically employ (***** et al., *****, 2004). *****-based treatment may have activity, 
 however, randomized trials are *****. ***** et al reported a 70% response rate in patients receiving capecitabine/temozolomide in the first-line setting (*****, et al. Cancer, 2011).    In this case--i favor continuing lanreotide for now.  Of note, tumors are very dotatoc avid, suggesting ***** might be a viable option down the road.    REC    #PNET  Patient to see Dr. ***** today.

Agree with findings demonstrating localized pancreatic mass at time of original diagnosis. The patient also had a recent CT scan on 10/21/2015 showing post-op changes, without evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 50 y.o. male now 5 months s/p ***** resection of a node-positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma, currently receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. He started with the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, but due to cumulative neuropathy and asthenia, he has now appropriately backed down to gemcitabine alone, which I would advocate he continue with to complete his full 6-month course of adjuvant therapy in total. We discussed the following additional issues at today's visit:    - While there is fairly incontrovertible evidence that systemic therapy improves survival for resected pancreatic cancer, the role of adjuvant radiation is much more debatable, with mixed data to support its use. There is a current cooperative group trial (RTOG 0848) that seeks to answer this question, but we would not expect a readout for at least a few more 
 years. I generally reserve radiation for fit patients who are at particularly high risk of locoregional recurrence (R1 resection, large primary tumor), and suggest waiting until after completion of systemic therapy before considering this modality rather than the 'sandwich' approach. On the whole, for Mr. *****, I do not see any specific features that would warrant offering chemoradiation after he completes his current chemotherapy.    - He was also interested in what additional therapeutic interventions might be offered after completion of his chemotherapy, including clinical trial possibilities. At present, we have none to offer him here at *****. While prior vaccine-based approaches (as ***** following standard adjuvant treatment) have been looked at in this post-resection setting at ***** and ***** *****, without clear evidence of benefit, I am not aware that any such studies are actively ***** at this time. I will contact my colleagues at these institutions to double-check and let the patient know is there is anything he may qualify for.    - Otherwise, we talked about a surveillance strategy after he completes his current treatment, including CT scans and bloodwork at ***** 3-4 month intervals, gradually spacing these surveillance studies out to less frequent intervals as time ***** and his risk of relapse diminishes after the first couple of years. Treatment at the point of relapse would depend on his pattern of recurrence, including radiation (standard or *****) for locoregional-only relapse, vs systemic therapy and possible clinical trials were he to develop evidence of metastatic disease.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction. I am certainly happy to see him again at any point in the future at his request or as clinically indicated.

To briefly summarize, in October 2021, Mr. ***** developed fatigue and subacute jaundice that prompted scans which demonstrated biliary ductal dilation and a mass in the head of the pancreas. An endoscopy and EUS were performed.  An ***** stent was placed.  FNA demonstrated pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  On 11/26/21, Mr. ***** underwent 
 pancreatoduodenectomy, which demonstrated invasive *****. Additional pathologic findings of note include *****, multifocal perineural invasion, negative margins, 4 out of 12 LN positive for carcinoma. This is considered AJCC 8th ed stage III disease. He has since recovered extremely well with few post-operative symptoms.  He currently is eating well and gaining weight and has excellent performance status (ECOG PS of 0).    We previously discussed the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in this context to improve disease-free and overall survival. Current standards of care are evolving; originally, this consisted of single-agent gemcitabine administered on a 3-week-on, 1-week-off schedule, for 6 months, based on the *****-001 study. Subsequently, the *****-4 trial demonstrated that the combination of gemcitabine plus capecitabine confers an even greater disease-free and overall survival benefit, for select patients who are fit enough to receive combination therapy. Most recently, the best phase III data have been reported with a modified ***** regimen (showing clear statistical superiority to single-agent gemcitabine).  Meanwhile, data from the ***** trial evaluating the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel in the adjuvant setting did not meet its primary endpoint of showing a PFS benefit compared to gemcitabine alone, with mature survival data still pending.      Following an extensive discussion of the risks/benefits of each regimen, Mr. ***** elected to proceed with *****. We discussed dose reduction of irinotecan by 25% due to advanced age and I recommended dose reducing oxaliplatin as well to 65 mg/m2 to avoid risk of thrombocytopenia. He received this dosing for C1 and 2 and in the setting of excellent tolerance, we increased irinotecan to 150 mg/m2 (full dose for C3). He tolerated C3 well without complications.  He continues to have excellent performance status. His labs and ***** ***** no

I counseled the patient that they are at increased risk of severe ***** illness and death due to their immunocompromised state.    I recommended that they pursue maximal vaccination in accordance with CDC recommendations for moderately to severely compromised individuals. The patient has received a total of 4 ***** vaccinations. Recommended bivalent booster in 2 months from last, due March 2022.   I additionally recommended ***** (***** co-packaged with *****) for Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) against *****-19, with PreP dosing to be separated from ***** vaccination by at least 2 weeks.. ***** is currently approved by the FDA for emergency use authorization and has been shown to reduce the risk of *****-19 in immunocompromised patients, with a protective effect maintained for a period of 6 months. He is scheduled for ***** 03/07/22.    Flu prophylaxis  Flu vax administered on 02/21/2022. The patient and family were counseled that all household members should receive the influenza vaccine.     As always, the patient was counseled to contact the clinic or the after-hours physician on call for any new symptoms or complications in the interim between now and his follow up visit with me.    Thank you for involving me in the care of this very kind patient.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.    I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting 
 in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    ***** *****, MD, MPH  Gastrointestinal Oncology

There is also proximal pancreatic duct dilation in the tail. There was also a 9 mm hypoattenuating lesion in hepatic segment 3, which is most likely benign in etiology, such as a hemangioma, however in the context of a possible pancreatic neoplasm, metastasis should be considered. Abdominal MRI could be obtained for further evaluation.    12/17/2020: EUS showed a 21.7 mm by 19.6 mm heterogenous hypoechoic area with ill defined margins in the head of the pancreas. There was an abrupt tapering of the pancreatic duct in the concerning for mass lesion.

110,Female,Asian,1957-09-29,"PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Ms. ***** is a 55 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.     ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Ms. ***** reports that she first notice yellowing of her urine in April 2012. She presented to the Emergency Room at ***** and was treated for a urinary tract infection on two separate occasions. On 07/25/2012 she presented with jaundice, low back pain and pruritis. A CT scan was performed which demonstrated a pancreatic mass. Ms. ***** subsequently presented to the ER at ***** with worsening abdominal pain and underwent a ***** procedure on 08/16/2012, performed by Dr. *****. A liver lesion was biopsied intraoperatively and was interpreted as pathologically most consistent with focal nodular hyperplasia. On post-operative day 3, she developed abdominal pain along with profuse serosanguinous drainage into her JP drain. She became hemodynamically unstable (hematocrit dropped to 14.8%), and was transferred to the ICU. On 08/19/2012, she was taken back to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy where arterial bleeding from the right adrenal artery and dehiscence of posterior duodenojejunostomy were discovered. A hematoma evacuation, right adrenal artery cautery, antrectomy, revision gastrojejunostomy were performed. She was subsequently noted to have a persistent leukocytosis, and a urine culture grew E Coli and enterococcus species for which she was treated with a course of antibiotics. She was extubated on 08/26/2012 and discharged on 09/15/2012. She briefly required nutritional support with TPN during her post-operative course which was discontinued prior to start of adjuvant gemcitabine.     On 10/09/2012 the patient initiated a planned 6 month course of adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy on a 3 week on, 1 week off schedule. Her Day 8 infusion was held for a 
 CTCAE grade 3 ANC of 0.97. Gemcitabine was resumed 1 week later with a 20% dose reduction (800 mg/m2). Her third infusion was held again last week for another episode of grade 3 neutropenia (0.75). The patient tolerated her first 2 infusions of gemcitabine well with no nausea, change in bowel habits, rash or fatigue. Low back pain increased following initiation of therapy, which prompted repeat imaging that demonstrated disease recurrence in the mesentery.     Given non-response to gemcitabine, her treatment was changed to a 5-*****-based regimen. She tolerated a first cycle of 5-***** plus oxaliplatin on November 28, without difficulty. Her regimen was escalated to ***** with cycle 2 on December 12. She subsequently developed alopecia, intractable nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea requiring hospitalization for symptom control and multiple visits to the Infusion Center for rehydration and potassium repletion over a period of a month. In light of the severity of her toxicity profile following a single dose of irinotecan, testing for for UGT1A1 polymorphism was performed which returned as *****1/*****1.     She resumed ***** (dosed with 25% dose-reduction of oxaliplatin and omission of 5-***** bolus) on February 01. Restaging scans after 8 total cycles of dose-reduced ***** demonstrated no measurable *****. Her *****-9 decreased from >3500 to 78 while on *****. She ***** on a treatment holiday in April; however, her *****-9 ***** up and restaging scans in mid-May demonstrated 2 new 1.2 cm lesions in the liver and Gerota's fascia. She resumed chemotherapy with 5-***** alone, with a *****-9 that increased from 1682 to >8000. Ms. ***** subsequently completed two additional cycles of *****, with a *****-9 that continued to rise. Restaging imaging demonstrated disease progression with more prominent soft tissue infiltration inferior to the pancreatectomy bed, interval increase in size of soft tissue masses along the inferior liver and 
 along right Gerota's fascia, and a new intrahepatic lesion in hepatic segment 2, compatible with new metastasis. Imaging also revealed significant gastric distention; however, a barium swallow study showed no evidence of gastric outlet obstruction.

Metastatic pancreatic cancer   Ms. ***** has completed 4 cycles of gemcitabine/abraxane.  Based upon 
 cumulative fatigue, I will hold treatment today and ordered restaging CT scans to be performed.      Loss of appetite  A previous upper GI series demonstrated no evidence of mechanical gastric outlet obstruction, and symptoms may be in part due to gastroparesis, possibly due to tumor infiltration of the celiac nerve and/or loops of bowel inferior to the right hepatic lobe.   She using metoclopramide for its pro-motility properties, and I instructed her today to increase dose to 10 mg four times daily.  She has resumed megestrol acetate for appetite stimulation.  Patient previously did not tolerate trials of Remeron or medicinal marijuana for appetite stimulation.   I provided a referral to Nutrition at today's visit.      Pain Control   Pain has remained controlled on ***** ***** dose of 120 mg BID. She will continue ***** suspension as needed for breakthrough pain. We previously discussed that her pain could possibly be relieved by celiac plexus block if it progresses despite medical management.     Insomnia   She will continue to take lorazepam and zolpidem as needed for insomnia.     I will plan to see Ms. ***** back following restaging CT scans.  As always, the patient was counseled to contact the clinic or the after-hours physician on call for any new symptoms or complications in the interim between now and her follow up visit with me. Thank you for involving me in the care of this very kind patient. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.    I spent a total of 25 minutes face-to-face with the patient and her family, with >50% of that time in direct counseling regarding her cancer diagnosis.  All of the patient's questions were answered to her and her family's satisfaction.

History is obtained from the patient as well as from the review of old records.    Patient initially presented in May 2012 with abdominal discomfort in ***** and epigastric regions. A CT abdomen obtained in June 2012 noted a 5.6x2.9x2.4 cm mass involving the body and tail of the pancreas with encasement of the celiac axis, splenic vein and splenic artery. EUS was performed on 07/25/12 and FNA revealed adenocarcinoma (CA 19-9 was 313). ***** was started for locally advanced disease and he completed 4 cycles (completed in September 2012). He tolerated it well except for neuropathy. On 10/20/2012, his CA 19-9 level was noted to be 1067.    On 10/22/2012, a cholecystectomy, subtotal pancreatectomy, splenectomy with resection of celiac axis and part of superior mesenteric vein, with bovine patch reconstruction of superior mesenteric vein (***** procedure) was performed. Pathology revealed ductal moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm with perineural and lymphovascular invasion. June 31 lymph nodes were involved by direct extension and the AJCC stage was ***** *****. He received adjuvant gemcitabine for 6 months (ending in May 2013).    Patient's disease was being followed by CT scans every 6 months along with CA 19-9 levels every 3 months. On 12/23/2013, a left lung nodule was noted measuring 4mm. In November 2013, CA 19-9 was measured to be 10. Subsequently, follow-up CT thorax on 08/02/2014 showed increase in the size of the 4mm LLL pulmonary nodule to 1.1 cm. In addition, a 0.3 cm 
 pulmonary nodule noted in December 2013, was noted to increase to 1.3 cm. This pulmonary nodule was spiculated and located in the left lung apex. Otherwise, there was postsurgical changes with soft tissue and stranding within the celiac artery and pancreatectomy resection beds which had increased from 11/28/2012 but unchanged from 12/23/2013. This was thought to reflect posttreatment changes. CA 19-9 level has continued to stay in the normal range.     On 08/30/2014, pulmonary lesion in the peri fissural left lower lobe was biopsied via CT guidance. During that examination, the nodule was noted to be 1.6x1.4 cm. Pathology showed adenocarcinoma, consistent with metastasis from ***** ***** (IHC positive for CK7 with patchy focal expression of *****; negative for ***** and TTF-1).     11/16/2014: completed 5000 cGy (out of 5000 cGy) to the LLL and 2500 cGy out of 2500 cGy to the ***** metastatic lesions, with *****.    02/14/15 PET/CT: New hypermetabolic 1.6 x 1.9 cm mesenteric lesion with surrounding stranding suspicious for metastasis. Interval decrease in the size and metabolic activity of the metastatic nodules in the left upper and lower lobe, reflecting response to the recently completed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy. Benign post radiation changes.   03/28/15: CT A/P showed increase in the size of the mesenteric nodule along with further increase in ***** 19-9 level. Subsequently seen by Dr. ***** ***** at ***** for consideration of *****-***** pancreatic cancer trial but was found to be ineligible due to low IGF-1 level, which was part of screening eligibility.  05/10/2015: Started Gemcitabine + Abraxane  06/27/2015: Restaging CT indicates stable disease in lungs but progression in enlarging mesenteric nodule. His CA 19-9 continued to trend down and so patient was continued on *****/Abraxane.   08/15/2015: CT indicates stable disease. Abraxane d/c due to worsening peripheral neuropathy.   11/14/15: CT scan shows stable disease. 
 Continue on single agent Gemcitabine  Last cycle (cycle 8) was on 12/05/15 with gemcitabine monotherapy.    Patient states that he recently traveled to ***** with his wife.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** ***** ***** is a 67 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patient received 4 cycles of ***** in the neoadjuvant setting and then gemcitabine in the adjuvant setting for 6 months (completed in December 2012). He then had recurrence in the lungs in 2014 for which he had *****. Most recently, he has been getting therapy with gemcitabine monotherapy (Abraxane d/c'ed in July 2015 due to neuropathy) and has stable disease on the most recent restaging scans obtained on 11/14/15. His CA 19-9 also has been declining since starting gemcitabine and *****-paclitaxel in April 2015.    At this point, he continues to be on gemcitabine monotherapy. I agree with omission of *****-paclitaxel due to the grade 2 neuropathy. Restaging scans can be obtained after 2 months of therapy (at the end of December and early January 2016) along with monthly CA 19-9 levels to monitor treatment response. If there is disease progression at that time, he can be considered for potential trials or he may be considered for 5FU 
 combined with liposomal irinotecan (*****-*****). In the phase III *****-1 trial, irinotecan liposome injection in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-*****) and leucovorin demonstrated a 1.9-month improvement in overall survival (OS) with the addition of irinotecan liposome injection to 5-***** (***** et al. J Clin *****. ***** ***** 2015).  Irinotecan liposome injection dosing is at 70 mg/m2 + 5-***** at 2400 mg/m2 over 46-48 hours every 2 weeks. The most commonly reported grade ?3 adverse events (AEs) with the combination were neutropenia (20%), fatigue (14%), diarrhea (13%), vomiting (11%), nausea (8%), asthenia (8%), and abdominal pain (7%).     If he continues to have stable disease with only a few mesenteric nodule involvement for some period of time, surgical resection of these nodules may be considered (though it is not common practice). Patient understands that even if this was a possibility, it would unlikely be a curative approach but would be indicated due to his young age, indolent disease and could be considered as an opportunity to turn back the clock.     In addition, in light of the recent data regarding the potential role of immunotherapy in *****-H metastatic pancreatic cancers, I would recommend obtaining MMR via IHC or MSI status via PCR (Le D, et al. ***** 2016 Annual Meeting; ***** 195).     #Supportive care: He will continue with ***** with meals. He will continue to use gabapentin for his neuropathy. I encouraged him to maintain his weight and to remain active while undergoing therapy.    We provided the patient with information regarding our clinic hours, phone number, important details of precautions during therapy. I provided them with an opportunity to ask questions and I believe that all of their questions have been answered to their satisfaction. We encouraged him to contact us with any questions or concerns. I would be happy to see the patient back in my clinic at any point in the future.    Thank you for 
 the opportunity to participate in the care of this kind patient. Please feel free to call me at any time at *****-*****-***** if you have any questions about the treatment, my recommendations, or if I can be of any assistance in the future.    *****,    ***** *****, MD, MS  Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine  Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology   UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center  12/30/2015

112,Female,Asian,1935-06-15,"Attending: ***** *****, MD    This is an independent visit    History of Present Illness  ***** ***** is a 82 y.o. female who presents to our GI Oncology practice at ***** ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. History is obtained from the patient as well as from the review of old records.    October 2017: Noticed dark stools. Took to local ED and diagnosed with ""duodenal ulcer"". Had EGD, ""treated with laser"" to stop bleeding, no further follow-up and imaging at that time.     November and December 2016: admitted two more times for nausea and vomiting.     12/28/17 CT Chest, abd, pelvis: Atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail with distention of the duct. An obstructing lesion is not visualized but is suspected. CA 19-9: <1, ***** 1.8, AFP 1.8.    12/31/17: EGD: Severe pyloric stenosis with retained food within the stomach  01/02/18: EGD/EUS: ESOPHAGUS - The mucosa had no ulcers or erosions, strictures, masses, or varices. STOMACH - Some retained food in stomach. This was mostly suctioned out. Pylorus stenosed. Unable to pass endoscope through. Under fluoroscopic guidance a wire was passed through the pylorus into the duodenum. TTS balloon dilation done from 10 mm to 12 mm. Following this the endoscope could easily be passed into the duodenum  DUODENUM - The duodenal bulb antero-inferior wall was edematous with friable mucosa. Multiple biopsies were obtained. The descending duodenum appeared normal.  Pathology: duodenal bulb: adenocarcinoma consistent with upper GI/pancreato-biliary primary (full results below under Pathology).    01/05/18: CT chest/abd/pelvis Pancreatic body hypodensity without alteration of pancreatic contour is present with abrupt transition from upstream marked  pancreatic duct dilatation to collapsed pancreatic duct, concerning for pancreatic neoplasm. Given the proximity of the pancreatic abnormality in the duodenal stenosis, 
 possibility of neoplastic involvement of the duodenum is considered. Lower abdominal mesenteric irregular spiculated mass adjacent  to the sigmoid colon measuring 1.2 x 1 x 2.2 cm is nonspecific  but concerning for a neoplastic process. CT Chest W Contrast: Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated lower lobe atelectasis 2. Abnormal mural thickening involving the distal esophagus, correlate clinically recommend correlation with recent endoscopy. 3. Distended stomach     01/06/18: EGD: ESOPHAGUS - Erosive esophagitis: Grade D -- mucosal breaks extending between folds involving >75% of circumference  STOMACH - High grade pyloric stenosis. Abundant fluid in stomach that was suctioned out completely. The endoscope could not be advanced through the strictured pylorus. Balloon dilation was then done by advancing a wire through the pylorus into the duodenum and then serial dilation from 8 mm to 10 mm. The endoscope could then be advanced into the duodenum  DUODENUM - ulcerated duodenal bulb as previously noted  EUS: Large hypoechoic amorphic mass in the pancreatic head measuring 43 mm x 39 mm. The mass obstructed the main pancreatic duct which was dilated to 11 mm. The mass also infiltrated into the duodenal bulb and there was compression and apparent involvement of the splenic vein/portal vein confluence. It was difficult to determine the extent of involvement of the vessel, and there was flow within the vessel. No obvious mass seen extending into the vessel.    01/08/18:  Underwent palliative surgery for gastric outlet obstruction. S/p gastrojejunostomy, cholecystojejunostomy, exploratory laparotomy and biopsy of mesenteric nodules x 3. Pathology from peritoneal/mesentery biopsies: adenocarcinoma c/w upper GI primary. C/b Right arm superficial thrombophlebitis involving both the basilic and cephalic veins, no e/o DVT.    03/18/18: PET/CT  1. Ill-defined FDG avid mass predominantly centered at the duodenum adjacent 
 to the proximal pancreatic body with dilatation of the pancreatic duct distal to the mass. 2. Additional hypermetabolic hepatic lesions consistent with additional sites of metastatic disease.    03/26/18: C1D1 Gemcitabine + Abraxane   04/08/18: ***** Gemcitabine + Abraxane     Interim History:   Patient presents for *****.

113,Female,Asian,1934-05-12,"Ms. ***** is a 80 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her high-grade neuroendocrine tumor of duodenal origin.     Oncologic History:   To review, the patient initially presented to the Emergency Department at UCSF Medical Center on 01/31/14 with several weeks of worsening crampy abdominal pain after intermittent epigastric pain for one year. Prior outpatient evaluation had been notable of elevated alk phos and AST/ALT. Diagnostic w/u during that UCSF admission included laboratory studies revealing an elevated bilirubin of 5.2, and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis that showed a 2.3 x 3 CM pancreatic head mass. She underwent ERCP with stent placement, leading to a resolution in her hyperbilirubinemia. Endoscopic findings included a necrotic mucosa presenting as an excavated mass beginning at the inferior angle of the duodenum, causing obstruction and obliteration of the distal bile duct. Biopsies of this lesion showed a grade 3 neuroendocrine tumor, with intermediate grade differentiation. Histologic markers were overall suggestive of a duodenal rather than pancreatic origin for this NET. Octreoscan was obtained, showing only mild uptake in the pancreatic head, and a serum chromogranin A was normal.     Ms. ***** was taken for surgical exploration and planned ***** procedure on March 14 given the absence of any metastatic disease on staging studies. Unfortunately, several liver metastases were identified intraoperatively, and surgery was therefore aborted. She underwent repeat ERCP with placement of a permanent metal metallic stent on March 16. Postoperative staging CT-PET showed a stable appearance of her pancreatic mass, and now the presence of several small hepatic lesions c/w metastases.     She is now s/p 5 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of the combination of capecitabine/temozolomide. Doses originally consisted of capecitabine 750 mg/m2 BID days November 25 
 and temozolomide 200 mg/m2 daily days August 25 of a 28 day cycle, generally well-tolerated overall. Because of progressive renal insufficiency early on during her treatment course, I dose reduced her capecitabine to 1000 mg BID x 14 days/temozolomide 200 mg days August 25 with cycle #3. Her serum creatinine subsequently normalized, and thus her chemotherapy doses were re-escalated to starting doses with her most recent cycle #4. MRI scans from early June demonstrated essentially stable disease.    On present review of systems, the patient notes:  - ***** fatigue, although trying ***** ***** active  - Mild sensitivity at incision site; otherwise, no abdominal pain  - Mild nailbed discoloration  - Eating well; no nausea or diarrhea  - No recent fevers, chills, or signs/symptoms of infection.  - Blood sugars under good control on current diabetic regimen    The remainder of the patient's review of systems was negative.    Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.

114,Male,Other,1983-11-13,"SUBJECTIVE:    This is a very pleasant 35-year-old Hispanic male who was diagnosed in October 2015 with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. At that time, he presented with back pain and a 15 pound weight loss. His metastatic disease at the time was limited to celiac lymph nodes. This was confirmed by FNA. He was treated with ***** for 8 cycles and then the oxaliplatin was dropped both because of a sensitivity reaction and because of increasing neuropathy. In July 2016, his chemotherapy was stopped and he was given a definitive course of chemoradiation. He did well until May 2018 when a new liver lesion was identified in biopsy confirmed. At that point, he underwent ***** to the lesion. He has been on surveillance since. A recent CT scan done shows new peritoneal metastases.    He has had germ line testing and this was negative for deleterious mutations. Tissue was sent to ***** 1 for genetic profiling but specimen was *****.    Clinically, he is doing amazingly well. He has no pain. He has had an intentional weight loss of 15 pounds. He complains of some gas but his stools are not oily or floating. He has a good appetite.    His oncologist at ***** relocated and he established his care at ***** a couple of weeks ago. As he was very interested in clinical trials, we decided to explore this with the phase I group as well as the immunotherapy team. We also contacted ***** regarding a cell therapy program. He is most interested in that and  traveled there on March 02 to have his immune cells harvested for expansion.    The protocol there are last for him to have bridging chemotherapy. He returns today to discuss that. He's had a follow-up CT scan.    He can continues to feel quite well. He does have some right upper quadrant discomfort which he manages with ibuprofen. He has residual low-grade neuropathy in his feet but it is exacerbated by cold temperature.    He has had germ line testing and is 
 positive only for VUS in *****, DICER1 and *****. His tumor tissue was ***** for analysis. We obtained a ***** study and he has a GNAS and ATM mutations    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:       MEDICAL ILLNESSES:  History of anxiety    PRIOR SURGERIES:  None    INJURIES:  None reported    CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  He is not taking any prescription medications.

Clinically nonfunctional and grade 2 (well diff) -- oddly enough, tumor is ***** neg-- so the role of sSA is unclear-- now off all treatment. We need more scans over time-- but early indicators suggest ***** over time.    According to NCCN guidelines, the treatment recommendations for PNET depending on extent of disease, rate of growth (e.g. stable or progressing), and whether or not the patient is symptomatic (bulky disease associated with pain and/or hormone-mediated symptoms. Numerous options may be considered, including chemotherapy, targeted agents, clinical trials, ***** and liver-directed approaches (including cytoreductive surgery and hepatic arterial embolization). Unfortunately, randomized trials are generally *****, thus limiting our ability to identify the optimal sequence of treatment.    Somatostatin analogs are known to provide symptomatic improvement in hormone-mediated symptoms in 75% of patients with carcinoid symptoms. As such, use of octreotide (SQ and/or *****) is considered routine in patients with symptoms consistent with carcinoid syndrome. In addition, data suggest that octreotide also has the potential to exert a cytostatic antitumor effect. The results of the ***** study (***** et al. *****, 2009) suggest that octreotide ***** 30 mg IM q month delays time to progression in patients with well-differentiated NET arising in the midgut or unknown primary site. Lanreotide also delays progression in nonfunctional ***** (*****, *****). The optimal 
 timing for intervention remains unclear (up-front at diagnosis or at the time of disease progression). As such, current NCCN guidelines suggest to consider octreotide at the time of disease progression in asymptomatic patients. In this case, the pt did not tolerate SSA and has discontinued -- may not be offering much in the setting of ***** negative disease.    Recent phase III data confirm that everolimus (4.6 vs 11 months; *****, et al. *****, 2011) and sunitinib (5.5 vs 11.4 mo; ***** et al. ***** 2011) delay progression when delivered as single agents in patients with radiologic progression. Radiographic responses are rare with either agent (e.g. <10%), but a five month improvement in time to progression was noted in both trials compared to placebo.    Treatment with systemic chemotherapy for well dif NET has yield variable results. Streptozocin-based chemotherapy was long considered standard and is FDA approved for this indication. The response rate is variable (as low as 6% in some studies),and this must be considered when weighing the relative merits and toxicity. *****, et al. reported a 39% RR in a retrospective series of patients with PNET, and this is the regimen we typically employ (***** et al., *****, 2004). *****-based treatment has activity per ***** (*****, ***** 2018)--approximately 30% RR with *****/***** and ***** alone-- but longer PFS with combination therapy (median PFS 22 mo v 14 mo with ***** alone). In this setting, chemotherapy seems like overkill given non bulky disease.    Current NCCN guidelines state that liver directed therapy may be considered in patients with liver-dominant, progressive well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Treatment (including surgical debulking, ablation, and/or hepatic arterial embolization (*****, chemoembolization, or selected internal radiation therapy) may palliate hormone-mediated symptoms and/or pain. In addition, liver-directed therapy may 
 slow disease progression, however, prospective randomized trials are *****.

116,Female,Asian,1932-08-04,"SUBJECTIVE:    This is a lovely *****-year-old ***** woman with a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma the pancreas. She was being followed for a pancreatic cyst that was diagnosed in 2014 on a CT scan. Follow-up MRIs for 2 subsequent years showed no change and this was presumed to be an IPMN. For some reason, her annual follow-up was not continued. In July 2019 she developed abdominal pain and the CT scan showed a mass in the tail of the pancreas, multiple peritoneal nodules and masses consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. She underwent an omental biopsy on August 16 which revealed an adenocarcinoma with features typical of and at adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.    We saw her shortly after her diagnosis and started her on gemcitabine and capecitabine. She has now had 4 full cycles and returns today for follow-up imaging. When we last saw her, she had a mixed response but as her CA 19-9 was dropping and she felt better, we continued her on treatment.    She has tolerated treatment well except for a lowered energy level. She is also on ***** at her residence because of *****-19 and is pretty b *****.

Enlarging right intraparotid lesion, likely related to pancreas or prostate cancer. This possibly represents a *****'s tumor, however FDG PET does not reliably characterize salivary lesions.         Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 67 y.o. male s/p resection of ***** ***** (*****) pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as well as a synchronous intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasm (***** resection 05/14/2020), c/b a ***** ***** delayed initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy.    He ultimately recovered adequately to be able to start treatment on 07/22/2020; ***** phase III data have been reported with a modified ***** regimen (showing clear statistical superiority to single-agent gemcitabine),specific to Mr. *****'s case,given his prolonged postoperative recovery and early stage disease,we opted to treat him *****-agent ***** a *****-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule, of which he completed 6 of a ***** cycles in total, generally well-tolerated. He has a  (+) Hep B core Ab status (not on prophylactic antiviral rx), but showed no signs/sxs of viral reactivation during chemotherapy.    Serial imaging studies since then have shown slowly growing pulmonary nodules c/w indolent metastatic disease, felt to be most compatible with his 
 pancreatic primary rather than his prostate. We had previously discussed at length the pros/cons of a lung biopsy and he ultimately underwent one on 05/07/2022, confirming metastatic adenocarcinoma c/w pancreatic cancer (further reinforced by the absence of uptake on PSMA nuclear medicine imaging).    After a period of time of taking a strategy of monitoring these ***** without immediately embarking on treatment, he ultimately started on treatment with ***** beginning in May and has now completed 12 cycles in total, required modest dose reductions along the way. While treatment was initially a/w overall stable disease, his latest CT-PET scans show some modest interval progression in his pulmonary metastases accompanied by a recent bump in *****-9 levels.    We discussed the implications of these findings and how they should inform the next steps and timing of his treatment; I do think building in a treatment hiatus for a period of time to allow him the opportunity to recover from the cumulative side fx of his recent ***** would be entirely reasonable. During this time he could meet with Rad Onc to assess his candidacy for ***** of his dominant lung lesions, acknowledging this might provide some local control but would have limited/ uncertain benefit on his overall longevity. I will refer him to our Rad Onc team here at ***** for this possibility.    In terms of options for further systemic rx either now or later, these could include:    - Returning to a gemcitabine-based combination regimen, such as gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel; or perhaps, most aggressively, even the 3-drug combination of gemcitabine, *****-paclitaxel, and cisplatin. Data supporting this ***** regimen come from a single-arm, phase 1b/2 clinical trial in the front-line treatment setting (n= 25 patients), in which there was an observed ***** 71%, ***** 10.1 months, and ***** 16.4 months (***** et al, ***** ***** 2020). For both these 
 regimens when administered in the pre-treated/2L setting, I typically will administer treatment on a ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) to allow more opportunity for count recovery in between doses; the risk of exacerbating his peripheral sensory neuropathy will need to be taken into consideration.    - Exploration of clinical trials. However, we are currently quite limited in any pancreas-specific trials we have to offer at our center right now, although I can refer him in the future to our Cancer Immunotherapy Program to be screened/placed in the queue for a couple of trials for which pancreatic cancer patients would be potentially eligible, including a bispecific anti-EGFR/CD28 antibody and a *****-directed allogeneic *****-T cell study.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his and his family's satisfaction. After he completes his radiation, I will see him again (in ~1 month's time) in anticipation of resuming his line of systemic rx.      Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Data elements reviewed: 3+ (CT-PET scan; bloodwork inc CBC, LFTs, *****-9).

118,Female,Asian,1962-04-23,"Ms. ***** is a 56 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her metastatic pancreatic cancer.     History of Present *****  This pleasant woman first presented in early 2018 with development of abdominal pain and was initially treated for GERD. However without significant improvement and weight loss of 20lbs in additional to new onset back pain and fatigue, she underwent an abdominal ultrasound that revealed both pancreas and liver lesions. Follow-up ***** ***** on 11/14/17 demonstrated a mass in the pancreatic body measuring 2.5 x 3.4cm with mild pancreatic duct dilation in the tail. Baseline CA 19-9 was found to be <2.    She was seen by Surgical Oncology (Dr. ***** *****) who recommended tissue biopsy and further staging with PET/CT.  CT guided biopsy of one of the liver lesions on 11/30/17 revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma staining positive for *****, CK7, and ***** as well as weak patchy positive for *****  and rare weak ***** positive staining c/w a pancreatic primary. PET/CT on 11/24/17 showed a 3.3 x 3.3cm mas in the pancreatic body encasing the celiac plexus and encasing and narrowing the ***** confluence.  Additionally, multiple hypermetabolic hepatic metastases were seen, largest 3.3 x 2.1cm as well as an enlarged portohepatic lymph node measuring 0.9cm.     She established care with medical oncologist Dr. ***** ***** on 12/09/17 and was started on systemic chemotherapy with ***** on 12/20/17.     Interval history/review of systems  Since her last visit on 01/09/18, ***** completed C3 of *****. She continues to improve, albeit slowly. Nausea was less of ***** with the last cycle, more prominent for the first 3-4 days of the cycle and home anti-emetics are helpful. She is eating well though drinking is still hard for her, ***** when she drinks at the same time as eating. She tries to have 2L of fluid per day but notes some day it is 
 more like 1L. She has been getting IV fluids at the infusion center regularly as she needs, last over the weekend on Saturday. She denies fever/chills/*****. She has been using the baking soda/salt rinses and has no mouth sores. She denies any cold-sensitivity or neuropathy with the last cycle. HR is better controlled the pat few days in 90s after titrating up on metoprolol to 75mg BID. She continues to take her xarelto with no issues with bleeding.

Oncologic Findings:  Index lesions:  1:  Primary pancreatic body mass : 3.3 x 3.3 cm, SUV ***** 9.7, (Se/Im November 307), previously 3.3 x 3.3 cm  2:  Largest hepatic metastasis, segment 2 : 3.3 x 2.1 cm, SUV ***** 10.6, (Se/Im November 281), previously 3.3 x 2.1 cm.  3:  Portohepatic lymph node : 0.9 cm, SUV ***** 6.8, (Se/Im November 306), previously 0.9 cm.    New lesions: None  Lymph nodes: Unchanged hypermetabolic portohepatic lymph node, indexed above.  Lungs: No metastases.  Abdominal and pelvic organs: Unchanged pancreatic head/body mass, indexed above, with unchanged associated encasement of the celiac trifurcation, encasement/narrowing of the ***** confluence, and distal pancreatic duct dilation and parenchymal atrophy. Soft tissue stranding contacts but does not frankly invade the greater curvature of the stomach. Soft tissue stranding surrounds but does not directly ***** the superior mesenteric artery. Unchanged multiple hypermetabolic hepatic metastases, indexed above, in segments 2, 3, 4.  Bones: No metastases.  Other: No 
 metastases.    Non-oncologic findings:  Brain:   Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum.  No mass effect.  While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated.  Neck:   Otherwise unremarkable.  Chest:   Otherwise unremarkable.  Abdomen/Pelvis:   Otherwise unremarkable.  Musculoskeletal:   Otherwise unremarkable.    IMPRESSION:   1.  Compared to recent prior dated 11/14/2017, no significant change in hypermetabolic pancreatic head/body mass, with associated vascular encasement, as detailed above.  2.  Unchanged multiple hypermetabolic hepatic metastases, measuring up to 3.3 cm.  3.  Hypermetabolic 9 mm portohepatic lymph node, likely metastatic.     PATHOLOGY:  FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS    Liver, core biopsy: Adenocarcinoma; see comment.    COMMENT:  Sections show most of the liver cores with an infiltrative moderately to  poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with gland formation, mucin  production, and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Sheet like growth is present in  some cores and there is necrosis and abundant mitotic figures. No  lymphovascular invasion is noted. Background liver shows patchy  lymphocytic inflammation, mild steatosis, and sinusoidal dilatation,  with the inflammation and sinusoidal dilatation likely representing mass  effect. No ballooned hepatocytes, globules, or significant pigment are  present.    Immunostains (CK7, *****, *****, *****, arginase, *****, *****, *****) show  strong diffuse tumor staining with *****, CK7, and ***** as well as weak  patchy ***** labeling and rare weak ***** staining. Arginase is negative,  to argue against hepatocellular differentiation. ***** shows probable  absent staining in tumor (though with overall weak staining of  background liver), which can be seen in pancreatic adenocarcinoma or  intrahepatic 
 cholangiocarcinoma (or some adenocarcinoma from other  sites). ***** shows intact staining, which does not provide any specific  support for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (but does not exclude it).    Overall, the morphology and immunophenotype are compatible with  metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but it is not possible to entirely  exclude an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (or less likely, another  primary site), based on the above findings, and clinical/imaging  correlation is suggested.     Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the status of DNA  mismatch repair protein expression on block A1. The results in the tumor  cell nuclei are:    ***** expression: Present.   ***** expression: Present.  ***** expression: Present.  ***** expression: Present.    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 56 y.o. female with MS-stable metastatic adenocarcinoma involving the liver who presents for follow-up.     # Metastatic adenocarcinoma  - Previously discussed non-curative nature of her disease and use of chemotherapy for palliation and life-extension.   - Labs and performance status okay to proceed with C3 ***** today 01/23/18.   - ***** plan for restaging imaging with CT chest/abdomen/pelvis after C4 and clinic appt to discuss results prior to C5 (tentatively mid February)   - IV hydration included in D3 orders to receive at time of pump disconnect. Encouraged additional PO fluid intake preferentially with meals when it causes less discomfort.   - ***** offer additional IC appts for IV hydration and anti-emetics as needed throughout cycle   - Given pancreatic malignancy and young age, referral to Cancer Risk for screening/counseling previously placed. Appt scheduled for 02/15/18.     # Atrial fibrillation, *****   - NSR on exam today. HR 91  - Continue metoprolol, recently increased to 75mg BID and ***** 20mg daily   - Cardiology f/u last on January 07 with NP *****    # HTN  - BP normal 
 range today *****/*****  - Continue metoprolol 75mg BID    # Supportive Care   ***** with nutrition as inpatient. ***** re-refer if needed    These recommendations were shared with the patient and her family with all their questions answered to their satisfaction. As always, the patient was counseled to contact the clinic or the after-hours physician on call for any new symptoms or complications in the interim between now and her follow up visit with me.

120,Male,Asian,1959-08-03,"Mr. ***** is a 56 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his metastatic pancreatic cancer. He initially demonstrated a favorable response to front-line therapy with the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, but repeat CT scans after cycle #7 of treatment demonstrated disease progression in his pancreatic primary and hepatic and peritoneal metastases.     On this basis, he initiated 2nd-line chemotherapy consisting of the combination of 5-*****/LV plus ***** irinotecan (nal-*****, or *****) of which he has completed 3 cycles.  Due to obstipation and anorexia following cycle #1, his doses were reduced by 20% beginning with cycle #2. At last week's visit with our NP, his declining performance status warranted holding of planned cycle #4, and referral to the UCSF ***** program (for home care) was initiated.    Interval history/review of systems  - Last large-volume paracentesis = 4L on 10/05/2015; relatively mild re-accumulation of ascites since then  - Minimal PO intake of solids or liquids; progressive anorexia/cachexia  - Occasional lightheadedness with several mechanical falls at home  - Increasing fatigue and weakness; only leaves house for medical appts  - Still passing flatus, BMs, and urine  - Easily cold, but no fevers/chills      Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.

Liver: Again demonstrated are multiple hypoattenuating liver lesions. In comparison with the prior examination from 08/22/2015, these have increased in size over the interim. For example, hypoattenuating lesion in liver segment VIII now measures up to 1.1 cm (previously measured 0.7 cm). Attenuating lesion in liver segment II has also increased in size over the interim and now measures 1.8 x 2.4 cm (previously measured 1.5 x 1.9 cm). Two adjacent hypoattenuating lesions in liver segment VI/V have also increased in size over the interim with the more anterior lesion measuring 2.6 x 2.0 cm and the more posterior lesion measuring 2.2 x 2.1 cm (previously measured 1.5 x 1.6 and 1.6 x 2.1 cm).  Gallbladder: Unremarkable   Spleen: Unremarkable  Pancreas: Interval increase in size of ill-defined mass in the intrahepatic body now measuring 2.7 x 5.47 m (previously measured 2.5 x 5.0 cm). When compared with the prior examination from 08/22/2015, there is interval increase in degree of ill-defined soft tissue extending into the retroperitoneum encasing the superior mesenteric artery and celiac artery. There is interval increase in degree of attenuation of the superior mesenteric artery.  New thrombus is noted within the superior mesenteric vein with interval increase in mass effect and new 
 complete short segment obliteration of the superior mesenteric vein at the portal splenic confluence.  Obliteration of the splenic vein is unchanged.   Adrenal Glands: Unremarkable  Kidneys: Unremarkable  Vasculature: Unremarkable  GI Tract: Unremarkable  Pelvis: Unremarkable  Lymphadenopathy: Absent  Ascites: Interval increase in now large abdominal ascites.  Bones: No suspicious lesions    IMPRESSION:   Interval worsening of disease with enlargement of pancreatic mass and worsening soft tissue infiltration involving the retroperitoneum, attenuation of the superior mesenteric artery, soft tissue encasement of the celiac artery and new ***** versus tumor thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein. Additionally, interval worsening of multiple liver lesions as described above.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 56 y.o. male with metastatic *****, progressing on second-line chemotherapy with the combination of 5-*****/LV plus ***** irinotecan (nal-*****, or *****), accompanied by a declining performance status. At this point, he is no longer a candidate for any further salvage treatment in terms of either SOC therapies or pursuing clinical trials. Therefore we had a ***** goals of care discussion in which I recommended that he refocus his goals purely on palliative/symptomatic measures, given that his expected longevity is likely measurable in weeks to 1-2 months at best. He and his partner understand and are in agreement. We have already moved ahead with making arrangements for home care through the UCSF ***** program with a transition to home hospice.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST  FINDINGS:  LUNGS:  Redemonstration of tumor related consolidation involving the right middle 
 and lower lobes which has increased in size compared to 06/01/2019. For example, the mass in the right middle lobe at the level of the cavoatrial junction measures approximately 5.0 x 10.0 cm in maximal transverse dimensions (previously 8.1 x 4.2 cm). Similar to prior, the mass invades the anterior chest wall and mediastinum where it abuts the right heart border with loss of intervening fat plane between the mass and right atrial blood pool. The mass also extends to the right hilum where it encases but does not significantly narrow the pulmonary artery and vein branches. Increased groundglass opacity and interlobular septal thickening throughout the aerated right middle and lower lobes, compatible with worsening lymphangitic spread of tumor.    Increased groundglass opacity and interlobular septal thickening in the left lower lobe at the site of treated metastasis which may represent posttreatment change. Remaining pulmonary nodules in the left lung are not significantly changed.    PLEURA:  No pleural effusion. Redemonstration of diffuse right pleural nodularity and enhancement compatible with pleural metastases.    MEDIASTINUM:   Similar appearance of right hilar lymphadenopathy.    HEART/***** *****:  Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion. Normal caliber of the aortic root and pulmonary artery.    BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  Increased conspicuity of sclerotic lesions involving multiple ribs, right greater than left, and the right inferior sternal body, compatible with osseous metastases.    IMPRESSION:   1.  Worsening metastatic disease in the right middle and lower lobes with increased tumor-related consolidation and lymphangitic spread of tumor.    2.  Increased ground glass opacity in the left lower lobe at site of prior radiation which may reflect evolving posttreatment change, however progression of tumor is not excluded. ***** of metastatic disease in the left lung is otherwise unchanged.    3.  
 Increased conspicuity of osseous metastases involving the sternum and multiple bilateral ribs, right greater than left.        Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 69 y.o. male now almost 2.5 *****/p ***** resection with portal vein reconstruction of a node-positive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(***** 02/08/2017), preceded by 6 cycles of neoadjuvant ***** (with minimal treatment effect pathologically), and followed by 4 cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (initially *****, producing moderate AEs requiring dose reduction of both agents;followed by gemcitabine alone), which he completed at the end of July 2017.    Approximately one year later he developed recurrence in the operative bed as well as *****(lung, LNs, and pleura), for which ***** a 6-month course of chemotherapy consisting ofthe combination of gemcitabine plus *****-***** ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle), which ***** overall disease control.    His disease showed minimal progression while off treatment for the next several months, and he underwent RT to the dominant lesion in his LLL of the lung on 03/23/2019.However, he is now progressing more substantially (including more recent evidence of abdominal wall/peritoneal metastases), for which he has recently resumed chemotherapy with gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel and has since completed 2 additional cycles on a ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle).     We reviewed his most recent imaging studies which demonstrate a mixed response; while some of his peritoneal metastases appear to have regressed, his largest lesion in the R middle lobe of the lung continues to enlarge. Given its central location with mediastinal involvement, I would favor d/c'ing current therapy, and trying to control this with ***** as his immediate next step, for which ***** ***** arrange for 
 an expedited referral back to ***** *****.    In terms of further systemic treatment beyond RT, we could perhaps try the combination of 5-*****/LV plus ***** irinotecan (nal-*****, or *****) vs ***** trial possibilities, although these would be more disease-agnostic and not ***** specific for pancreatic cancer. Of note,Foundation One molecular test results performed ***** archived surgical ***** notable only for ***** ***** mutation.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his and his family's satisfaction. *****-term f/u will be arranged after his radiation.

A portal vein reconstruction was required as part of the operation. The pathologic specimen from his surgical procedure was interpreted as a 2.2 cm well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with extension into the peri-pancreatic soft tissue and perineural invasion. Tumor was present 1 mm from the posterior surgical margin. February 27 lymph nodes were involved with adenocarcinoma.     Following recovery postoperatively, he proceeded to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine x a total of 6 cycles (3 weeks on, 1 week off) at a dose of 800 mg/m2 (dose-reduced after first cycle 2o to cytopenias). Therapy was completed in mid-August.     On present review of systems, the patient notes:  - Soft daily BMs  - Mild olfactory changes  - Mild residual incisional pain  - No recent fevers  - No SOB, cough  - Reasonably good appetite.

Mild FDG uptake along the CBD.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 79 y.o. male 11 months s/p ***** resection of a node-positive pancreatic cancer, followed by adjuvant gemcitabine. We opted not to pursue RT given equivocal data to support its use, plus considerable potential morbidity. He looks and feels well overall, aside from some endocrine and exocrine insufficiency post-surgery/treatment. However, he does have some radiographic findings on ***** ***** *****-PET concerning for possibly pulmonary metastases (the hypermetabolic activity along the CBD is less specific, and not a typical pattern of disease recurrence). For now, I would not immediately embark on resuming treatment, but closely monitor these findings with a repeat scan again in mid-February. In the best case scenario, lung-only metastases can follow a very indolent course and not require treatment for a number of months or even a year or more. At the point of needing to consider systemic therapy, accounting for the patient's age and mild CRI, we could think about capecitabine (+/- oxaliplatin), or possibly gemcitabine in conjunction with *****-paclitaxel.    All of the above considerations were explained to the patient and his daughter, who understand and are in agreement. F/u will be arranged with me again in mid- to late- February.

Dense sclerosis of the left iliac bone is likely benign. 5) Right ***** interstitial fibrosis, possible bronchiectasis   - 01/17/21: AST 237, ALT 365 AP 495 TBili 7.7  - 01/20/21: US ABD: 1. 2.2 cm mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas with dilated pancreatic duct, marked intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation as well as a distended gallbladder. 2) gallbladder wall polyps  - 02/10/21: ERCP with sphincterotomy and ***** bare metal stent placement; noted 3cm malignant stricture in distal common bile duct  - 02/10/21: FNA - head of pancreas - adenocarcinoma; modest cellularity and cohesive clusters of malignant cells. MMR intact  - 02/12/21 - Admission for acute pancreatitis, likely 2/2 post-ERCP. Course was complicated by pseudoaneurysm in her duodenopancreatic arterial branch requiring IR embolization. NJ was placed for tube feeding, though removed   - 02/20/21 - ERCP with metal stent placement overlapping indwelling stent. Duodenal stricture, likely related to ongoing pancreatitis.   - 02/20/21: CT Chest: 1) Unchanged scattered sub-4mm pulmonary nodules. 2) Unchanged lucency in the T4 vertebral body. Mild anasarca. Left 
 chest wall loop recorder. 3) Slight interval increase in small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  - 02/20/21- CT A/P: Focal contrast density compatible with active bleeding immediately lateral to the midportion of the common bile duct stent, with new blood products within the enlarging peripancreatic collection. Additional trace linear contrast density within the peripancreatic collection may represent trace tracking blood products or small irregular vessels. 2.)Obscured pancreatic head mass with worsening peripancreatic inflammatory changes of acute pancreatitis. The hemorrhage described above may represent sequela of stent related vascular injury versus hemorrhagic pancreatitis. 3.) New absence of pneumobilia with unchanged severe intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, concerning for stent malfunction due to clotted blood products. 4.) Worsening mild right hydroureteronephrosis from ***** ***** inflammation.  - 02/25/21 - discharged from hospital  - 02/27/21: CT A/P 1) Large pancreatic pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas extending into the anterior pararenal space. This measures 8.6 x 4.7 x 9.4 cm. 2) There is moderate right hydronephrosis due to encasement of the proximal/mid right ureter by the pseudocyst. 3) Small 4 mm nodule seen peripherally in the left lower lobe.   -03/12/21: Initial visit with *****; discussed ***** starting chemotherapy with *****   03/15/21: Hospitalized at ***** ***** with fever, found to have stable cystic pancreatic mass (10.5cm), thought to be source of fever, s/p IR drain (in place) March 16.  Discharged to complete 10d course of augmentin    03/24/21: PETCT: 1.  Hypermetabolic pancreatic head mass status post metal biliary drain placement. Evaluation of locoregional extent of disease is limited by surrounding peripancreatic fluid collection.  2.  Within this limitation, no clear nodal or distant metastatic disease. Unchanged ***** 
 small periportal lymph node. Scattered small pulmonary nodules are unchanged. Unchanged ***** T5 vertebral body lucent lesion.  3.  Decreased size of peripancreatic fluid collection status post percutaneous drainage placement. However, there is a new component of the collection involving the right psoas muscle, new air within the collection, and increasing right hydronephrosis likely related to adjacent inflammation. The collection makes broad contact with the duodenum and, to a lesser extent, the ascending colon. While air within the collection is likely related to instrumentation, fluoroscopic tube check or repeat CT abdomen pelvis with oral contrast could be obtained to evaluate for fistula.  1.  For further details on ***** ***** imaging, see separately dictated report.    04/09/21: ***** with ID, Dr. *****-***** *****.

Pneumoniae (not *****). Now that source control seems to be achieved, has been on moxifloxacin to achieve high bioavailability and cover both Klebsiella and other anaerobes since ~March 30. Repeat CT unclear if fluid collection is improving in size, will need to continue drain, with additional complication of having to start chemotherapy (no known ***** with moxifloxacin). At this point would continue moxifloxacin until drain output reduced to the point of being able to be removed, plus an additional 2 weeks after drain removal to ensure sterilization and not stop until repeat imaging shows near or complete resolution. If she develops complications of ***** use (joint 
 inflammation, tendonopathy, prolonged QT) could switch back to ***** or an oral 3rd gen cephalosporin (cefdinir or cefpodoxime) as needed.    -04/17/21: Case discussed at ***** tumor board: given that she achieved source control as well as continued improvement on ***** *****, the decision was made to keep the drain to gravity and start a trial of chemotherapy. She will remain on suppressive Moxifloxacin for the duration of treatment.  -04/20/21: Presented for C1D1 *****/abraxane.

 CURRENT THERAPY AND DATE INITIATED: No systemic therapy; metal stent placement due to high-grade common bile duct obstruction, complicated by pancreatitis and pseudoaneurysm in the local arterial branch requiring embolization TECHNIQUE: Patient's fasting time was > 6 hours. Following intravenous administration of 6.8 mCi of F18-FDG, a nondiagnostic, low dose CT was performed for localization and attenuation correction purposes. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 55 minutes after FDG injection. PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data. PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted. Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images. Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 114 mg/dL. For further details on simultaneously acquired diagnostic CT imaging, see separately dictated report.

127,Male,Asian,1938-01-28,"Mr. ***** is a 80 y.o. male who comes to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in consultation for his pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all his outside records.    History of Present Illness  This pleasant Chinese-speaking gentleman with multiple medical co-morbidities originally presented in June 2018 with subacute onset of epigastric/RUQ pain and fairly subtle jaundice symptoms. Initial diagnostic w/u at the time included an abdominal U/S (07/23/2018) notable for marked intra and extrahepatic biliary duct dilation, with no obstructing mass identified but a possible choledochal cyst. Subsequent CT scans that same day confirmed biliary dilatation, felt likely 2o to obstructive choledocholithiasis, with associated cholecystitis but again no discrete mass appreciated. MRCP (07/25/2018) failed to visualize a pancreatic head or common bile duct mass at the location of distal common bile duct caliber change; with irregular thickening and enhancement of the gallbladder fundus.    ERCP was performed on 07/24/2018), with extraction a CBD stone and placement of two 7F x 10 cm stents bilaterally above a high grade stricture in the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct. He has since undergone several additional ERCPs, most recently on 09/30/2018, for biliary stent exchanges. Additionally, EUS on 10/08/2018 demonstrated a 20 X 16mm irregular and hypoechoic mass in the head of the pancreas, invading into the common bile duct; as well as a hypodensity of the ***** that was suspicious for tumor involvement of the gallbladder. FN biopsy (25G SharkCore needle) confirmed adenocarcinoma.    The patient's most recent imaging studies consisted of repeat CT scan performed on 09/17/2018, notable for interval development of 4.8 cm mass centered in the gallbladder fundus with hepatic invasion concerning for gallbladder carcinoma; as well 
 as a focal area of low attenuation in the pancreatic head measuring 21 mm.    The patient's present review of systems was reviewed and notable for the following:  - Mild abdominal discomfort (not requiring any analgesics)  - Tolerating POs adequately, w/o postprandial nausea/vomiting  - ~20-lb weight loss  - Minimal to no recurrent jaundice symptoms post-stenting  - Regular BMs, usually well-formed with occ diarrhea  - No recent fevers/colds  - No pre-existing peripheral sensory neuropathy  - Occasional bouts of dizziness (related to BP/cardiac medications)  - No chest pressure/SOB a/w atrial fibrillation  - Still independent with ADLs; ECOG PS 1    The remainder of a full review of systems was negative.

I personally reviewed and interpreted the patient's relevant imaging studies in conjunction with the corresponding formal radiology reports, as follows:    CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS (09/17/2018)  FINDINGS:    Visualized lung bases:  Bibasilar atelectasis. Biatrial enlargement. Calcification of the coronary arteries and mitral annulus.    Liver: Interval placement of biliary stents in the right and left biliary ducts. Persistent intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation suggestive of biliary ductal stent malfunction.     Gallbladder: New 4.8 cm mass centered in the gallbladder fundus with hepatic invasion. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.    Spleen:  Unremarkable    Pancreas: Focal area of low attenuation in the pancreatic head measuring 21 mm which may represent focal pancreatitis.    Adrenal Glands:  Unremarkable    Kidneys:  Unchanged 2.5 cm simple cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney. Revisualization of few subcentimeter hypodensities in bilateral kidneys that are too small to characterize.    GI Tract:  Unremarkable    Vasculature:  Moderate atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and its branches. Unchanged aneurysmal dilatation of distal abdominal aorta measuring 3.3 x 3.0 cm. Unchanged aneurysmal common iliac arteries measuring up to 2.5 cm on the right and 1.9 cm on the left.    Lymphadenopathy: Absent    Peritoneum: No ascites    Bladder: 
 Unremarkable    Reproductive organs: Prostatic calcifications.    Bones:  No suspicious lesions. Unchanged anterior compression deformity of T12 vertebral body.    Extraperitoneal soft tissues: Unremarkable    Lines/drains/medical devices: None    IMPRESSION:   1.  Interval development of 4.8 cm mass centered in the gallbladder fundus with hepatic invasion concerning for gallbladder carcinoma.   2.  Focal area of low attenuation in the pancreatic head measuring 21 mm which may represent focal pancreatitis, however cannot exclude malignancy. Recommend close attention on follow-up.  3.  Interval placement of biliary stents in the right and left biliary ducts with persistent ductal dilatation suggestive of stent malfunction.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 80 y.o. male with what appears to be a primary pancreatic head adenocarcinoma with metastatic gallbladder/liver involvement; vs a multifocal biliary tract/GB cancer. To date, his disease has been managed by biliary stenting, which will require regular exchanges every 6-8 weeks.    Based on his advanced age, multiple medical co-morbidities, and extent of disease (I would actually like to repeat CT scans at this point, to evaluate for interval change/growth since his prior scans >1.5 months ago), he is clearly not an operative candidate, nor do I see a clearly defined role for radiation/*****. We discussed why the mainstay of any treatment would focus on systemic therapy to try to control the growth and spread of *****, to ideally achieve as deep and durable a remission as possible, and to potentially palliate symptoms in the process; but with the clear understanding that cure is not an expected outcome and that it would be important to carefully weigh the risks/benefits of therapy and to prioritize ***** considerations in the process.     In his case, I would like to try gemcitabine in combination with *****-paclitaxel on a ***** 
 dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) to see how well he can tolerate it, with a low threshold to stop if it adversely impacts his ***** or causes excess toxicity. We discussed the logistics, scheduling, and some of the potential side effects of this regimen including but not limited to nausea/vomiting, alopecia, fatigue, cytopenias with resultant immunosuppression and/or anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.     He understands and is willing to give it a try. In addition to obtaining a new baseline CT scan, we will arrange for anti-emetic prescriptions and a chemotherapy teaching session with one of our practice RNs in anticipation of starting treatment in the next 1-2 weeks. F/u to see me or my NP will be arranged shortly thereafter.

SUBJECTIVE:  This is a very pleasant 61-year-old woman with a new diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. She had symptoms for a couple of months and eventually developed a gastric outlet obstruction. She was hospitalized at ***** and had a palliative bypass with a *****-en-Y duodenal jejunostomy.    At the time of that procedure, she was found to have peritoneal and nodal involvement. Biopsy of a peritoneal nodule was positive for adenocarcinoma.    We initially saw her for consideration of chemotherapy a couple of weeks ago. At that time, she expressed interest in the ***** trial. Her tumor tissue was tested and was positive for high *****. She elected to go on the ***** 301 trial.    11/14/2017: Cycle 1 day 1 *****/PL + Gemcitabine + Abraxane study.     During her first cycle of therapy she developed protracted nausea and vomiting and was sent to a local hospital and then transferred to ***** to a larger facility. At the time, she could not be transferred to ***** because of a *****. While the sequence of events remains uncertain, she was noted to have GI bleeding from multiple gastric ulcers and she also developed a pneumonia with an associated empyema that required chest tube drainage. She eventually was transferred to *****. She did develop a upper extremity DVT which was associated with a IV infusion site. She was started back on Lovenox.She was able to be discharged on 01/03/18.    01/09/18: CT CAP reveals radiographic response - Compared to 11/07/2017, there is significant interval decrease in size of large pancreatic body/tail and mesenteric masses.

129,Female,Asian,1942-01-21,"Ms. ***** is a 79 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her ***** adenocarcinoma.    History of Present Illness, reviewed:  This pleasant woman with cardiac history (inc CAD, reduced EF, and PAF, s/p recent drug-eluting stent placement) and chronic hepatitic C was undergoing surveillance imaging on a q6 monthly basis for her HCV. On most recent MRI last month (08/06/2018), she was noted to have a 1 cm pancreatic neck lesion (see formal report below). This was followed by dedicated CT scans (08/14/2018), confirming a pancreatic head mass measuring 1.9 ***** vascular encasement or abutment, but ***** stranding around the celiac ***** spread; as well as multifocal ground glass and solid nodules within the ***** indeterminate significance.    This was followed by EUS performed on 08/23/2018, confirming around mass in the genu of the pancreas ***** mm by 20 mm in maximal cross-sectional with poorly ***** borders, and abutment of ***** mesenteric vein. FNA confirmed adenocarcinoma, ***** proteins all intact by IHC.    ***** and evaluated by surgeons both at ***** (*****) and UCSF (*****), as well as Med Onc at ***** (*****);***** primary tumor ***** be potentially *****, given the patient's recent cardiac history she was recommended to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    She initiated ***** on 09/11/2018. Cycle #4 was postponed ***** ***** port infection,a hospital admission on 11/01/2018 for atrial fibrillation with RVR, associated with intermittent chest pain and SOB. She was diuresed for fluid overload and underwent cardiac catherization on 11/05/2018without evidence ***** stent *****.Echocardiogram showed an EF of 55-60%. She recovered sufficiently to be able to resume treatment on November 15 (cycle 
 #4) with an empiric 20% dose reduction in her ***** 5-*****; beginning cycle #6, her doses of oxaliplatin and irinotecan were also reduced by 20% due to recurrent thrombocytopenia ***** sequential treatment delays. She completed 7 cycles of treatment (last cycle from January 25 - 01/26/2019), with planned cycle #8 delayed 2o to a Hgb of 6.8, with no evidence of active GI bleeding. She was tx'ed 2u PRBCs at that time.    We agreed at that point to ***** chemotherapy and proceed next to consolidative radiation, which she received in the form ***** (33 Gy over 5 fractions) from March 22 through 04/03/2019.She ***** further treatment.    F/u surveillance imaging in late October 2019 ***** soft tissue encasement of the celiac trunk and common hepatic artery with increased pancreatic ductal dilatation and rapid tapering, compatible with worsening disease; as well as a new left liver lobe intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation tapering to a 9 mm enhancing focus, suspicious for a hepatic metastasis. This was followed by an MRCP (12/19/2019), demonstrating multifocal arterially enhancing liver *****/w metastatic disease.    On this basis, she resumed chemotherapy ***** combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel(at 100 mg/m2) ***** ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle)beginning 12/20/2019. ***** course since then has been notable for the following:    - Planned cycle 1 day 15 gemcitabine dose was held x 1 week and reduced by 20% due to ANC of 0.8.  -She was briefly hospitalized on 01/07/2020 ***** SOB, c/f exacerbation of HF and volume overload.W/u *****-proBNP >*****,EKG stable x2,***** neg x 2. She was diuresed ***** for d/c after an overnight stay.  - With her second chemotherapy infusion on 01/09/2020, she received only her *****-paclitaxel;shortly after ***** she was noted to have ***** 
 heart rate and was alternating between bradycardia and *****.Rapid response team was called, but patient felt better and ultimately avoided hospitalization.  - Planned resumption of chemotherapy on 01/22/2020 was again delayed 2o to ANC of 0.53; resumed on 01/29/2020 (representing cycle 2 day 1) with ***** prophylaxis.  - Interval imaging (CT scans on 03/18/2020) ***** stable disease.  -*****.5cycles of treatment in total, at reduced doses of both gemcitabine (800 mg/m2) and *****-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2), with ***** factor support.  - Thereafter, based on evidence of good disease control, regimen was simplified to single-agent gemcitabine ***** ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle), which ***** on through 09/16/2020 (10 cycles of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy overall) before taking a treatment ***** be able to spend a few months in *****.  - Developed ***** fullness in October *****; upon return to *****.S., noted to have elevated LFTs including tot bili of 5.5, AST/ALT *****/***** (11/24/2020).She did not appreciate any jaundice symptoms.Updated CT scans showed disease progression in ***** pancreatic ***** and a new hepatic hilar lesion. On 11/27/2020 she underwent ERCP ***** of a 7 ***** across the hepatic ***** and into either segment 4 ***** system with good drainage.  - She was able to resume chemotherapy with the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel (again at 20% dose reduction of both agents), on a ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle), beginning 12/10/2020.  - Following cycle 2 day 15 of chemotherapy (01/27/2021) she began experiencing recurrent fevers. Repeat CT scans on February 04 were notable for ground-glass opacifications in the LLL of the lung, possibly representing a CAP, as well as increasing biliary ductal dilation of the R hepatic lobe. Rx'ed with empirically with 
 PO antibiotics on an outpatient basis, but was ultimately admitted to the hospital on 02/05/2021 to r/o sepsis. ERCP was performed on 02/09/2021 with 3 plastic stents placed in the right anterior, right posterior and left intrahepatic ducts. Also noted was a suspected abscess coming off the right anterior segment. She was covered with IV -> PO antibiotics and d/c'ed to home on 02/12/2021.  - Chemotherapy resumed on 02/24/2021; completed one additional cycle of rx (last dose = 03/10/2021)  - Admitted to ***** (03/21/2021) 2o to cholangitis for which she was started on ***** *****. One day into hospitalization, experienced large bloody BM and acute drop in *****, with hypotension and afib w/RVR, that prompted transfer to *****. On EGD was found to have *****-***** tear that was banded. Subseq ERCP performed on 03/24/2021 with new biliary stents in both left hepatic and right intrahepatic ducts. D/c'ed to home on 03/28/2021 on PO antibiotics, and back on Eliquis.

 radiology reports, as follows:     03/21/2021 CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS  FINDINGS:  Lower thorax: Right atrial enlargement.     Liver and biliary tree: Biliary stent from the right hepatic duct into the duodenum. Interval placement of biliary stent with tip in the left hepatic duct with tip in the proximal jejunum. Similar degree of intrahepatic bile ductal dilation, left greater than right. Interval increase in biliary enhancement (for example August 64). Multiple wedge-shaped peripheral areas of hypoattenuation, predominantly of the right hepatic lobe, which are increased/new from prior, the largest in segment 4A/8 (November 42 and August 46). These regions do not persist on delayed imaging however there is some new faint capsular retraction. Some of these areas have small associated lesions which are new, for example the 5 mm lesions in segment October 02 (July 38-40 and 03/12/16). Unchanged hepatic cysts.     Gallbladder: Fundal adenomyomatosis.     Spleen: Punctate calcified granulomas.     Pancreas: Similar atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail. Main pancreatic duct is similarly dilated measuring up to 9 mm with focal tapering at the head the level of the ***** pancreatic mass measuring approximately 2.0 x 2.0 cm (August 98), previously measuring 2.1 x 1.9 cm. The splenic and portal vein are encased by tumor. This mass causes mild portal vein stenosis and moderate to severe splenic vein stenosis (September 070). The splenic artery and proper hepatic artery are encased by tumor with severe stenosis of the proper hepatic (August 92) and moderate narrowing of the splenic artery (July 93). Similar stranding around the SMA and celiac root.     Adrenal glands: Unchanged nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland. The right adrenal gland is normal.     Kidneys and ureters: Subcentimeter renal hypodensities are too small to characterize but are statistically likely to represent renal cysts. Punctate hyperattenuating focus of the right interpolar region, 
 possibly representing a nonobstructing stone (September 135). No hydronephrosis.     Gastrointestinal tract: Interval resolution of rectal stool ball. No evidence of obstruction.     Peritoneal cavity: Trace free fluid in the pelvis. No free air.     Bladder: The bladder is distended.     Uterus: Surgically absent.     Ovaries: Not visualized.     Vasculature: Atherosclerosis without aneurysm.     Lymph nodes: Prominent peripancreatic nodes which are not enlarged by size criteria.     Abdominal wall: Normal.     Musculoskeletal: Degenerative changes of the spine. Unchanged heterogeneous appearance of the left proximal femur.    IMPRESSION:   1. Multiple new peripheral peripheral wedge-shaped hypodensities in the liver, favored to represent perfusion anomalies, some which have new tiny associated lesions which could reflect metastases or abscesses.     2. Increase in biliary enhancement/thickening which may represent cholangitis. Interval placement of left hepatic biliary stent. Right hepatic biliary stent is in unchanged position. Similar degree of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation.     3. Redemonstration of 2cm pancreatic head mass which encases and causes stenosis of the upper abdominal vasculature as described above.         Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 79 y.o. female with chronic HCV (with complete response following antiviral rx 10-***** ago) and cardiac disease (CAD/PAF/CHF),***** in ***** potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She received induction chemotherapy with 7 cycles of *****, requiring several dose delays and serial dose reductions along the way due to a bout of rapid Afib/CHF exacerbation (of unclear attribution to her chemotherapy, i.e.fluoropyrimidine- associated cardiotoxicity) and cytopenias (thrombocytopenia/anemia). Repeat imaging after that time demonstrated essentially stable disease in terms of her primary 
 pancreatic mass, along with pulmonary findings c/w mild heart failure, while her *****-9 levels declined to normal range. ***** went on to complete a course ***** ***** (Cyberknife) through early March 2019,with the decision not to pursue surgery thereafter due ***** co-morbidities (particularly her underlying cardiac issues) *****.    By *****, f/u surveillance imaging ***** evidence of locoregional disease progression as well ***** metastases, for which ***** restarted *****, ***** *****/*****-paclitaxel at a ***** dosing schedule and at reduced doses of both agents (plus ***** prophylaxis).***** a/***** on, due to recurrent cardiac issues(not clearly attribute to her chemotherapy)***** toxicity.After 5.5 cycles, interval re-imaging ***** good disease control,while *****-9 tumor markers remained within normal range. *****, her regimen was ***** gemcitabine alone as a form of 'maintenance' treatment (continuing with the ***** dosing schedule, i.e.days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle)for several additional cycles, before taking a chemotherapy holiday starting in late August 2020.    During her treatment-free interval over the next several months, she developed both locoregional and (modest) hepatic disease progression, resulting in biliary obstruction that has necessitated ***** stenting of both the L and R intrahepatic biliary systems, with multiple exchanges since then in the context of recurrent cholangitis. Repeat ERCPs will be scheduled at ***** in an additional 4-6 weeks' time; she was counselled to watch for signs/sxs of recurrent biliary infectious in the meantime.    She is now back on chemotherapy consisting of ***** reduced-dose gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel. Treatment has been interrupted on a couple of occasions due to hospital 
 admissions, most recently related to recurrent cholangitis (s/p biliary stent exchange) and an upper-GI bleed 2o to a *****-***** tear; this has been banded, with no evidence of recurrent GI bleeding since then. We reviewed her most recent imaging studies performed during that hospitalization that show essentially stable disease, with non-specific liver findings (?***** abnormalities) but no clear metastatic disease progression.    We had another discussion during today's visit re: the importance of carefully weighing the risks/benefits of ongoing chemotherapy and needing to prioritize ***** considerations in the process. At this point, we agreed that she warrants a break from chemotherapy; we will plan on short-term follow up CT scans and bloodwork (right after *****), with a follow up appt to see me thereafter to decide on the necessity of resuming chemotherapy at that time.    Future options beyond gemcitabine-based chemotherapy might consist of ***** her with *****-based regimen (*****, or the combination of 5-*****/LV plus ***** irinotecan (nal-*****, or *****)); or assessing her candidacy ***** trials depending on her fitness level and goals of care; at this point I would consider her a fairly marginal trial candidate. Of note, we have not had tumor tissue available for molecular (somatic) profiling; at the point of needing to consider next steps in her treatment I would like to order liquid biopsy (*****) analysis to assess for any actionable mutations/genetic alterations. She previously declined germline testing.    From a cardiac standpoint, ***** to ***** ***** cardiologist and, after being loaded on digoxin during her hospital admission when she was in ***** w/RVR, is now back on her beta-blocker plus Eliquis. She presently appears stable. From a symptom management perspective, we talked about trying Tylenol for her abdominal 
 discomfort as the immediate next step; her exam today is entirely benign.    All of the patient's questions were answered ***** her family'*****.        Time spent:  ***** ***** minutes reviewing the patient's records, including interim history, in ***** time *****, and in post-visit charting.    Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities.

130,Male,Asian,1942-02-20,"OBJECTIVE:  This is a very pleasant 75-year-old Chinese gentleman good English *****, who also has a prior history of left lung transplant for interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. He presented in the end of June with shortness of breath fatigue and lower extremity edema. He was found to have a hemoglobin of 4.6. Was felt that he did have a GI bleed although nor source was found on either colonoscopy or on upper GI endoscopy. Apparently further studies were not done. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a lesion in the tail of the pancreas along with ascites and multiple liver lesions. An EUS was done on July 17 and a fine-needle aspiration revealed adenocarcinoma. He was transfused and a referral was made to our clinic.    In the interim, he went down ***** ***** ***** and was admitted twice for anemia requiring transfusion. Also a DVT was identified at some point and he was placed on Coumadin. He continues on Coumadin now.     We initially saw him two months ago. Because of his comorbidities and poor performance status, we recommended gemcitabine monotherapy. He is now been through 3 cycles of alternate week fixed dose rate gemcitabine.

131,Male,Asian,1977-11-11,"Mr. ***** is a 37 y.o. male who comes to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in consultation for his metastatic pancreatic cancer. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all his outside records.    History of Present Illness  This gentleman first developed nausea/vomiting, waxing/waning, beginning in November 2014, but progressively worsening over time. Labs drawn by his PCP demonstrated an elevated lipase, prompting his presentation to his local ED on 01/06/2015 for further w/u of presumed pancreatitis. Abdominal U/S showed multiple liver masses consistent with malignancy. Subsequent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a 6 cm irregular mass in the body of the pancreas with encasement of the hepatic and splenic arteries and invasion of the third portion of the duodenum with obstruction, and multiple hepatic metastases. CT-PET confirmed a pancreatic body primary tumor infiltrating into the left adrenal fossa and to the third portion of the duodenum: 6 x 4.6 x 5.2 cm/SUV 5.1; extensive, confluent liver metastases; numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules; at least 3 hypermetabolic skeletal metastases (sacrum, mid T5 vertebral body); small volume ascites; omental nodularity and peritoneal thickening; and numerous mesenteric lymph nodes. Spine MRI showed focal signal abnormality in the S1 vertebral body, and areas of disc protrusion at T12-L1 and L3-4.    During the patient's hospital admission, he was maintained on a liquid diet and rx'ed with anti-emetics. Liver biopsy was performed on 01/08/2015, which apparently showed metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of pancreatic or biliary origin (formal report N/A).    The patient's present review of systems was reviewed and notable for the following:  - PO intake modest, including soups and some solids. No/minimal postprandial vomiting; nausea under reasonable control on anti-emetics  - 
 50 lb weight loss in total  - Some constipation, uses Colace regularly.  - Some urinary retention as well  - Pain primarily in sacral region; on combination of MSO4 and Percocet. ***** insomnia.  - No jaundice  - No fevers, night sweats  - No cough/SOB  - No pre-existing peripheral sensory neuropathy  - No worsening glycemic control since cancer diagnosis  - No frank depression/psychosis    The remainder of a full review of systems was negative.    Past medical history  1. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  2. Hypertension.  3. Hyperlipidemia.      Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.

I agree with findings demonstrating a large pancreatic body mass with vascular encasement, with multiple hepatic metastases, small pulmonary nodules, and omental/peritoneal nodularity.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 37 y.o. male with newly diagnosed, extensive metastatic pancreatic cancer. He is still in decent shape with an ECOG PS of 0. We discussed the following at today's visit:    The mainstay of treatment at this point should consist of systemic therapy, that 
 the goals of such treatment treatment are to produce disease control and hopefully extend survival, while possibly alleviating cancer-related symptoms, but would not be expected to achieve cure.    There are several possible chemotherapy options for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of therapy depending on the patient's age, performance status, co-morbid conditions, and personal preference. The two current gold standards for front-line treatment, based on phase III data, include:    - ***** (biweekly ***** 5-*****, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin), which was shown in a phase III French cooperative group trial to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in terms of overall survival, PFS, *****, and other clinical outcomes. Side effects of this regimen were discussed, including but not limited to immunosuppression, risk of infection, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. I explained that this regimen requires placement of a Mediport due to the ***** component of therapy (48 hour infusion of 5-*****). Furthermore, because of the high incidence of grade _ neutropenia with this regimen, we tend to give primary prophylaxis with growth factor support (***** or Neupogen) after each treatment cycle.  - The combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, which was shown in a phase III international trial (*****) also to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Side effects and logistics of this regimen were also explained.  - For patients too frail or with medical co-morbidities that may preclude the administration of combination chemotherapy, gemcitabine monotherapy represents an appropriate choice.    Certainly clinical trials also represent an ideal option. We discussed with the patient in detail about two study possibilities we have available here at ***** for 
 the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer, and he was sent consent forms for both of these ahead of time to review:  (1) the ***** trial, a randomized phase II trial evaluating the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel with or without *****-*****, a bispecific monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R and *****. For this study, patients are initially screened by measurement of serum free IGF-1 levels, as only those with high IGF-1 levels are randomized. The study also requires tumor tissue for assessment of intratumoral Heregulin (HRG) expression, although there is no cutoff for study eligibility. ***** the nature of clinical trial and specifically the study rationale, treatment regimen, screening tests and logistics of the above clinical trial.   (2) a phase II trial consisting of the combination of gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel plus ibrutinib.    After much discussion and consideration, the patient is inclined to move ahead with SOC chemotherapy with *****. He is in fact already scheduled to have a Mediport placed through his local oncologist tomorrow, and will let us know w/i the next day or so whether he wishes to receive his treatment locally vs here at *****.    The other issues we covered included:  - Pain management: A new script for ***** ***** was provided for long-acting RTC pain control. Future consideration could be made for EUS-guided celiac plexus nerve block as well if he does not respond adequate to opioid analgesics.  - Given his young age at presentation, I will make a referral for him to be seen at our Cancer Risk program for genetic counseling, despite the absence of a family history of cancer.  - The patient does have some pain referrable to the sacrum, with PET and MRI suggesting some osseous metastases in that area. For now, I will see how this responds to systemic therapy, but we could consider spot RT to that area in the future.    All of the patient's questions 
 were answered to his and his partner's satisfaction. If he chooses to receive his care at ***** we will get him set up to start within the next week or so.

Patient Identification and Oncology History  ***** *****-***** is a 58 y.o. female with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She presented to a local emergency department on 04/10/2019 with 2 weeks of excessive fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Laboratory evaluation at that time demonstrated elevated liver enzymes with Tbili of 6.6. This prompted a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed 1.8 cm hypodense mass within the pancreatic head, with evidence of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. She underwent an ERCP on 04/11/19 with placement of plastic stent. Biopsy of the ampullary mucosa was negative for any evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. She then had a repeat CT of the A/P with pancreatic protocol on 04/15/19 which demonstrated a 2.1 x 3.0 x 2.8 cm mass in the uncinate process extending to the ampulla and head.     She was eventually referred to ***** (Dr. *****) and underwent and EUS/ERCP on 04/26/2019 which measured the mass at 3.5 x2.0 cm in the head head/uncinate process of pancreas. FNA from this demonstrated malignant cells consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, NOS. She was reportedly referred to an oncologist and planned to have port placement for initiation of chemotherapy this upcoming week. However, she presented to UCSF emergency room on May 16 for evaluation of anxiety related to her diagnosis. CT A/P was repeated on 05/17/19 which demonstrates 3.4 x 3.4 x 4.7 cm hypoattenuating mass at the 
 pancreatic head with some peripancreatic LAD and scattered hepatic nodules, largest measuring 1.4cm.     06/05/2019- liver biopsy: PATH - atypical cells concerning for adenocarcinoma.   06/07/19 - C1D1 *****. ***** = 277.6, CA 19-9 = 15  06/21/19: ***** ***** - with dose reduced irinotecan for better tolerance    07/04/19: *****. ***** = 392.9, CA 19-9 = 22  07/18/19: C4D1 *****  08/01/19: CT CAP showed increase in the size of the hepatic lesions. However, the abd/pelvis scan was compared to 05/17/19 which was prior to the start of chemotherapy on 06/07/19. I would like continue on this regimen as I am not certain if this is true progression due to the lag time between the comparator scan and the current scan. Therefore, I would like to continue on this regimen for another 3 cycles and would like to obtain early look scan in 6 weeks.   08/02/19: ***** ***** - Oxaliplatin reduced by 20% for better tolerance.   08/16/19: Seen in ***** to evaluate for potential *****-19 due to fatigue and report of ***** - upon evaluation not found to be at risk.  08/16/19: ***** *****    09/06/19: ***** *****     Interim History  She has been feeling ok and no changes in level of fatigue. She had minimal nausea with this last cycle. Her constipation is managed with Miralax and stool softener. No issues with neuropathy; just transient cold sensitivity.

See comment.    COMMENTS:   The ***** are moderately cellular and reveal rare atypical glandular cells in a background of benign hepatocytes. The atypical cells are seen  to best advantage on the cell block. The atypical cells are mildly enlarged with dense vacuolated cytoplasm and have enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular contours and coarse chromatin.  Immunohistochemical and cytochemical stains were performed on block A1 with the following results in atypical cells:    Stain      Target      Result  CK7      Epithelial      Positive  MOC-31      Epithelial      Positive  *****     Hepatocytes     Negative (+in hepatocytes)  *****      Mucin      Positive    The staining pattern supports the morphologic findings. Overall, the findings are atypical and suspicious for adenocarcinoma; however the  paucity of tumor cells present precludes definitive diagnosis.

 female who presents to our GI Oncology  practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for a follow-up visit of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with biopsy proven liver metastasis. Patient was started on ***** 06/07/19 and has been tolerating it well with dose reduction of irinotecan by 20% starting with cycle 2.    Her restaging scans from 08/01/2019 showed increase in the size of the hepatic lesions. However, the scans were compared to 05/17/19 which was prior to the start of chemotherapy on 06/07/19. For this reason, we recommended to continue on ***** as we were not certain if this is true progression due to the lag time between the comparator scan and the current scan.     She continued to have clinical decline with worsening fatigue and also weight loss. She requested a week delay in chemotherapy which has helped with her symptoms. She has now completed 7 cycles of chemotherapy.    Her most recent restaging scans from 09/18/19 showed overall stable disease in the liver but increase in the size of the pancreatic primary. I called and spoke with the radiologist to get a better understanding of the primary pancreatic tumor characterization. He noted that there is increased enhancement around the tumor so concerning for progressive disease. As her ***** has not decreased either and she has had a difficult time tolerating this regimen, my recommendation is to switch her therapy to gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel.    I reviewed the potential side effects of this regimen including but not limited to: neuropathy, cytopenias increasing the risk of infections and bleeding, requirements for blood transfusions, alopecia, rash, edema, fatigue, infusion reaction, nausea/vomiting, myalgias. She will also undergo formal chemo teach prior to starting.    -plan for gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 + *****-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15 out of 28-day cycle.   -We will plan for a CT chest, 
 abdomen and pelvis to be obtained after 2 months of therapy and will monitor ***** levels monthly.     I reviewed the scan results and these recommendations with the patient and her family during today's visit. I provided them with an opportunity to ask questions and I believe that all of their questions have been answered to their satisfaction.     #R shoulder and arm limited ROM and decreased strength: Continues   - MRI from July 23 showed: Moderate grade articular sided tear of the subscapularis, articular sided tear of the supraspinatus, subacromial subdeltoid bursitis, and degenerative tearing of the superior ***** extending into the biceps *****.  - An external referral to ortho was placed during prior visit.    # Supportive care:   - Continue ondansetron and Compazine alternatively to better manage her nausea.     #Follow-up: 2 weeks when she is due for *****  As always, we reminded the patient to call us with any questions or concerns in the meantime.      I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.    ***** *****, MD, MS  Clinical Assistant Professor in ***** *****   UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center

He is being treated in a neoadjuvant fashion with *****.   Last treatment was more than 2 weeks ago and it is not clear to me that there is a ***** cycle planned here.   I would agree with this approach, in general, but the patient could use a bit more education as to the scheduling of the infusions and the use of home nausea meds and the such.  Also not clear why this ambulatory fit man is getting inpatient *****.   We discussed that he should get 4-6 cycles over 2-3 months and then reimage with a quad phase protocol CT to assess resectability.   I referred him to Dr. ***** and mentioned that it needed be until after the CT scan is done in ~2 month's time.  
 At that point, depending on the response, surgery or radiation Rx could be considered, or more chemo if the impression was that a response was ongoing.

History of Present Illness  ***** ***** is a 57 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology practice at ***** ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. History is obtained from the patient as well as from the review of old records.    In October 2015, he was admitted for syncopal episode after experiencing dyspnea and flushing with Niacin. A CT chest angio was obtained on 10/26/15, which was negative for PE but noted 2 liver lesions along with pancreatic tail mass measuring 5.8x3.9x3.5 cm. Patient reports back pain starting in 09/03/15.  During that hospitalization, patient was noted to have LFT abnormalities and was evaluated by Dr. *****.    On 12/02/15, MRI abdomen was obtained which revealed a pancreatic tail mass measuring 6.2x6.1x5.1 cm. 4 hepatic lesions of largest measuring 2.7x2.1x2.1cm in the left lobe of the liver and 3x2.7x3.1 cm in the right lobe of the liver were also noted. These were concerning for metastatic disease.    An EUS was performed on 12/12/15 which revealed a pancreatic tail mass measuring 3x2.8 cm with liver metastases and some small peripancreatic nodes. The mass was noted to ***** the splenic artery without clear invasion. EUS staging was T3. Biopsy of the pancreatic mass revealed adenocarcinoma. Biopsy of the liver lesions was not performed. Of note, he had an 
 EGD/colonoscopy one year previously and only gastritis was noted.     He states that he lost approximately 34 lbs since November. He has been drinking Ensure for nutritional support. He is experiencing fatigue but he still tries to stay active. He has difficulty falling asleep but reports taking naps during daytime. He notes constipation over the past year.

There is geographic regions   of differing signal within the liver suggestive of a fatty liver.    There are 4 hepatic lesions again identified. One is noted in the   left lobe of the liver measuring 2.7 x 2.1 x 2.1 cm. There is   adjacent small 8mm Satellite lesion. Another lesion by the ***** of   the right lobe of the liver measures 3.0 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm. These   demonstrate 
 increased T2 signal and demonstrate early peripheral   nodular enhancement. The third lesion is in the right lobe of the   liver on image 27, series 903 and measures 1.0 x 0.8 cm. These do not   demonstrate significant fill-in on the delayed 20 minute images. They   are not isointense to liver on the delayed hepatocyte phase.    There is a heterogeneous lesion involving the tail of the pancreas.   The proximal portion measures 3.4 x 3.2 cm and demonstrates   *****. The distal portion is more cystic measuring 4.6 x   2.7 cm. There is adjacent dilatation. There is peripheral enhancement   of the cystic component.     CONCLUSION:  Large heterogeneous mass involving the tail of the pancreas which   measures approximately 6.2 x 6.1 x 5.1 cm. This is highly suspicious   for pancreatic carcinoma.    There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no intra-or   extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.    There are at least 4 hepatic lesions which likely represent   metastases.    ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** is a 57 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He saw Dr. ***** in clinic today as well. He has 4 hepatic lesions which are concerning for metastatic disease. We will arrange for biopsy of the hepatic lesions, to get pathologic confirmation that he has metastatic disease. If there is pathologic confirmation of metastatic disease, we will consider him for one of our clinical trials vs systemic chemotherapy (***** vs gemcitabine and *****-paclitaxel).     I reviewed that in the setting of metastatic pancreatic cancer, cure will be unlikely but that our efforts will be focused on making his disease into a chronic disease while preserving quality of life.  I informed them that treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer involves systemic therapy. Systemic therapy can include 
 chemotherapy, targeted therapies or immunotherapy. In general, if there are clinical trials available, we also strongly recommend consideration of a clinical trial participation. The standard chemotherapeutic options include modified-*****, gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel, or single-agent gemcitabine.     During today's visit, I also reviewed the our clinical trials for front-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. We currently have two trials:  1) ""*****#***** ***** Randomized, *****-*****, *****-Controlled Phase ***** ***** ***** *****-***** plus *****-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine versus *****-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in *****-Line Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer (*****)"" in which patients with high IGF-1 serum levels are randomized to receive gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel or to receive gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel plus *****-*****, which is a tetravalent bispecific antibody antagonist of IGF-IR and *****.    2) ""*****#***** ***** Phase Ib/II Safety and Efficacy Trial of Ibrutinib Combined with Gemcitabine and *****-Paclitaxel in ***** with Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma"" in which patient with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receive gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel plus Ibrutinib, which is a *****'s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK) that prevents B-cell activation and B-cell mediated signaling.    My recommendation would be consideration of the ***** trial to determine if the patient has high serum levels of IGF-1. If he is found to have low serum levels of IGF-1, I would recommend proceeding with consideration of the latter trial studying the role of Ibrutinib.      If the patient agrees to proceed with standard chemotherapy, we will monitor treatment response with monthly CA 19-9 levels and restaging CT scans every 2 months. He will need baseline CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with contrast prior to initiation of chemotherapy. We will also obtain baseline labs including CBC with 
 diff, LFTs, chemistry panel and CA 19-9 prior to his first cycle of chemotherapy.     As the patient has a strong family history of cancer and due to his young age at diagnosis, we will request assistance from our genetic counselors for evaluation of a possible hereditary pancreatic cancer syndromes. We have placed a referral to our Cancer Center dietician for weight maintenance. We will provide a prescription of antiemetics and anti-diarrheal medications prior to the initiation of the chemotherapy. I provided handouts on chemotherapy regimen details and provided him with an opportunity to ask questions. I believe that I was able to answer all of his questions to his satisfaction.     He will return to ***** ***** in clinic after the pathology from the biopsy is available.     #Hyperbilirubinemia: T. Bili 1.9 on prior labs; we will get labs prior to next visit to make sure that there is not further increase in bilirubin. If there is worsening hyperbilirubinemia, we will have to obtain imaging to evaluate for biliary ***** and potential ERCP for consideration of stent placement.    #HTN: Not well-controlled today. He didn't take lisinopril this morning.  -I recommended that the patient take the lisinopril today and daily as prescribed by his PCP.    We provided the patient with information regarding our clinic hours, phone number, important details of precautions during therapy. I provided them with an opportunity to ask questions and I believe that all of their questions have been answered to their satisfaction. We encouraged him to contact us with any questions or concerns. I would be happy to see the patient back in my clinic at any point in the future.    Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the care of this kind patient. Please feel free to call me at any time at *****-*****-***** if you have any questions about the treatment, my recommendations, or if I can be of any assistance in the 
 future.    *****,    ***** *****, MD, MS  Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine  Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology   UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center  12/25/2015

135,Female,Asian,1956-07-22,"Ms. ***** is a 56 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her metastatic nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Previous treatment has included a distal pancreatectomy of her primary lesion back in 2002; several subsequent radiofrequency ablations for liver confined disease; and a short period of Sandostatin that was poorly tolerated with significant GI symptoms.     We had also been considering the possibility of liver-directed embolization (***** or Y-90) of her slowly growing hepatic metastases, but due to her vascular anatomy post-resection, she was determined not to be a candidate for this. More recently, Dr. ***** ***** took her back to the OR in September 2011 for planned repeat laparoscopic RFA, but found such significant adhesions of small bowel to liver and abdominal wall that he could not safely dissect the anterior surface of the liver to perform the ablation.     The patient has since started systemic therapy with everolimus, an oral mTOR inhibitor, beginning in October 2011. Serial CT scans since then have demonstrated essentially stable hepatic metastases (see most recent results, below). Due to some gastrointestinal issues with the everolimus affecting her daily *****, her dose was decreased from 10 to 7.5 mg daily beginning in April 2012, which she has been handling well overall.    On present review of systems, the patient notes:  - Admitted for partial SBO at the end of May x 5 days, managed conservatively with NG tube decompression; since then, she has been doing fine (gradually advancing diet, now on low-fiber diet). Everolimus held during that period of time, resumed two weeks ago.  - Bowel movements have returned to baseline (currently 1-2x/day; better than previous more frequent BMs).  - Energy level is fine, working and exercising.  - No polyuria.  - No significant localizing areas of pain at present; does not 
 require any regular analgesics.  - No recent fevers/chills.    The remainder of the patient's review of systems was negative.

Some of the lesions demonstrate interval increase in size while others are decreased in size compared to most recent prior. This could reflect a mixed response to treatment versus differences in technique between studies. No new lesions are seen.       Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 56 y.o. female with oligometastatic liver disease from a non-functioning PNET, with evidence of good durable disease control and reasonably good (in fact, improved) tolerance on current everolimus at reduced doses of 7.5 mg daily. We discussed the following issues and plan:    - Watch for signs/sxs of recurrent bowel obstruction.  - My review of her most recent CT scans show essentially stable disease, with minimal growth in some measurable lesions ***** by similar degree of reduction in others. We will continue to image at approx 6 month intervals.  - She should continue with q3-4 month labs including CBC, LFTs, creatinine, glucose, PO4, and cholesterol panel.  - Recent Endocrinology evaluation for diabetic management, presumably prompted by everolimus; discussed potential plan to start non-insulin pharmacologic rx in the future. Patient is following blood sugars at home.  - No plans for repeat locoregional ablative/embolization therapy in immediate future.

136,Male,Asian,1932-09-02,"Follow Up    Mr. ***** is a 89 y.o. male whom I am seeing as a video visit at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in consultation for his pancreatic cancer. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all his available  records.    History of Present Illness  09/12/19: Local ED with 1mo abdominal bloating, weight loss *****, dark urine and light stools  US: Fatty liver, no malignancy in liver.  Interval bilary ductal distension  CT A/P: Distended gallbladder as well dilated intra and extrahepatic bile ducts with abrupt transition point at the ampulla raising the concern for choledocholithiasis versus malignancy  09/13/19: EGD/EUS: An irregular oval mass was identified in the pancreatic head at the head/neck junction. The mass was hypoechoic. The mass measured 25 mm by 18 mm in maximal cross-sectional diameter. The endosonographic borders were *****.  There was sonographic evidence suggesting <180 degree involvement of the portal vein, splenoportal  confluence and SMV, over a length of -15 mm.   FNA path: Adenocarcinoma  09/13/19: ERCP: Two 10 mm by 4 cm uncovered metal stents were placed into the common bile duct  across the stricture (the first stent did not fully traverse the stricture, so a 2nd overlapping stent was placed)  Discharged 09/13/19  09/21/19: CA 19-9: 49, AST 29, ALT 111, Tbili 0.6  09/28/19: CA 19-9: 84  09/28/19: CT Chest (UCSF): *****   09/28/19: CT AP Pancreatic Protocol (UCSF): Ill defined hypodense mass in the pancreatic uncinate process measures up to 2.5 cm, consistent with known pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The mass abuts the main portal vein and superior mesenteric vein at the portal-SMV confluence.  Several small subcentimeter hypodense lesions in the pancreatic parenchyma. The several of these lesions are favored to reflect small cysts. However there is an Indeterminate lesion in hepatic segment June 24 measures 18 mm. Recommend further evaluation with MR liver examination 
 with ***** if clinically appropriate.  10/01/19: Consultation with surgeon, Dr. *****: Tumor is resectable but,  recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink tumor and potentially avoid vein reconstruction.  10/19/19: C1D1 Neoadjuvant Gemcitabine + Abraxane  11/02/19: ***** Neoadjuvant Gemcitabine + Abraxane  11/16/19: ***** *****/Ab  11/30/19: ***** *****/Ab (Final cycle)    12/07/19: CT AP demonstrates growth of his segment June 24 lesion now 3cm from 0.8cm on 09/28/19, however stable pancreatic primary.

I saw ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** Oncology  practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in ***** ***** *****. ***** *****.    History of Present Illness  Ms. ***** is a 69 y.o. female who initially presented with jaundice in August 2011, at which time an ERCP with placement of biliary stent was performed for what presumably was a malignant biliary stricture. This was complicated by some post-procedure pancreatitis. Repeat ERCP with EUS at ***** apparently confirmed a mass in the head of the pancreas, which was biopsied and revealed adenocarcinoma (original report N/A). She underwent a ***** procedure on 10/01/11 at Chinese Hospital, with pathology revealing moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring at least 2 cm with no lymph node involvement (0/21 lymph nodes). The tumor was noted to invade muscularis propria of duodenum extending into bile duct margin.    The patient was started on adjuvant gemcitabine starting on 01/05/12, originally dosed as weekly for 3 weeks for the first cycle, followed thereafter by once a month dosing for 6 cycles under the care of Dr. ***** *****. CT abdomen/pelvis obtained on 08/31/12 revealed a 1.7cm cystic structure in the pancreatic body and a new 1.5 soft tissue density posterior to the proximal SMA with partial encasement. In addition there was an ill-defined sclerotic density within the L2 vertebral body. Subsequent PET/CT was obtained which showed dilatation of the pancreatic duct in the body and tail with a cystic area proximal to it, suggesting possible recurrence. There was also increased FDG activity in the L2 vertebral body (SUV 4.9) which corresponded to the sclerotic lesion concerning for metastasis, as well as the 1.5x1.4 cm soft tissue nodular lesion in the left paraaortic region also concerning for metastatic lymphadenopathy.     Patient 
 continued to receive gemcitabine administered q3 weeks, but her CA 19-9 continued to increase (38 (July 2012) to 179 (October 2012) to 328 (November 2012) to 700 (January 2013). Her last dose of gemcitabine was at the end of December 2012. She states that after the last cycle of chemotherapy, it took her awhile to recover in terms of fatigue and dizziness. However, currently her energy level is good and she has been working out, practicing ***** ***** to keep active. Her appetite is only fair and she does not tolerate meat and fish. She uses ***** 2 capsules with meals and 1 capsule with snacks. She has been losing weight to a total of 6 lbs over past 6 months. She has nausea but no vomiting. She has abdominal pain but denies any back pain, and is not using any pain medications.  Her BMs are regular 3x per day and well-formed.     Review of Systems  General: no recent fevers or chills, poor appetite, good energy, weight stable  Skin: no rashes, lesions or jaundice  Eyes: no vision changes  HENT: no change in hearing, no nasal discharge or sinus tenderness. No mouth sores or sore throat  Respiratory: no cough or shortness of breath  Cardiovascular: no chest pain, or palpitations, no leg swelling  GI: positive for nausea.

No carcinoma in 21 regional lymph nodes (0/21).  Extensive perineural invasion seen.  Malignant glands are seen coming to about 0.1 cm of peripancreatic margin.  AJCC stage pT3N0.    Imaging  PET/CT 09/16/2012  Dilatation of the pancreatic duct body and tail.  There is a cystic area proximal to this area.  No FDG PET activity but present CT scan findings are suggestive of recurrent neoplasm.  Increased FDG uptake within the L2 vertebral body SUV 4.9.  This corresponds to a sclerotic lesion in the right portion of the posterior vertebral body measuring 1.3 x 1.5 x 1.7 cm.  This is consistent with a sclerotic metastasis.  There is focal increased FDG uptake SUV 3.3 in the left periaortic region corresponding to a soft tissue nodular lesions measuring 1.5 x 1.4 cm.  The findings are suspicious for metastatic lymphadenopathy.  The nodes are inferior to the pancreas and at the level of the lower panel of the left kidney.  There is mild FDG uptake within the right hilar lymph node next SUV 3.1 as well as within the left peritracheal lymph nodes SUV 2.9.  The area of uptake in the PET scan in the right hilum measures 1.6 x 1.2 cm.  The area of uptake in the left periaortic region measures roughly 0.6 x 2.2 cm.  There was a 0.3 x 0.4 cm soft tissue attenuation nodule in the right lower lobe immediately posterior to the minor fissure in the anterior segment.    CT abdomen and pelvis 08/31/2012  1.7 cm cystic structures seen in the region of the pancreatic body.  
 Pancreatic duct dilatation in the residual body and tail.  Soft tissue density demonstrated posterior to the proximal SMA with partial encasement measuring 1.5 cm. Interval appearance of an ill-defined sclerotic density within the L2 vertebral body when compared to 08/31/2011 scans.      ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** ***** is a 69 y.o. female who presents to our GI Oncology  practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of her recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Following her original ***** operation, she received adjuvant gemcitabine, mostly dosed in a somewhat unusual fashion of once-monthly. She now has evidence of recurrent disease based on suspicious radiographic findings (local recurrence plus presumed metastatic disease to the lymph nodes and L2 vertebral body) and a rising *****-9 biomarker. Apparently the patient had a repeat PET/CT obtained last week, while off treatment for the past month-plus, although we currently do not have the report or the images available for review. We will work on obtaining these as well as getting a full set of laboratory studies during patient's visit today.     Her ***** off-treatment is reasonably good, and depending on the extent and progression of her disease we will decide on the need and timing of re-initiating chemotherapy. The patient understands that such treatment would be for prolongation of life (but not cure) and possibly symptom palliation. As the patient has concerns about chemotherapy and the side effects related to systemic therapy, our recommendation would be try treatment with ***** or ***** and see how well she tolerates it. We reviewed some of the potential side effects including but not limited to : bone marrow suppression increasing the risk of infections, bleeding and transfusions, nausea,vomiting, diarrhea, cold sensitivity,mucositis, neuropathy, and hand-foot syndrome. We provided the patient and his daughter to ask 
 questions via a Cantonese interpreter and we believe that all of their questions were answered to their satisfaction.    In the meantime, we have placed a referral to the Cancer Center nutritionist for recommendations regarding dietary intake. In addition, we have asked the patient to have her PICC line removed ***** and will instead arrange for the patient to have a chest port placement for venous access. She will follow-up with us again in one week to discuss details regarding treatment options.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns.     ---------------------------------  This is attending ***** *****. *****, MD, ***** non-ACGME fellow Dr. ***** *****'s note.

140,Male,Asian,1983-05-07,"VIDEO VISIT  I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.      Mr. ***** is a 37 y.o. male whom I am seeing as a video visit at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his resected *****.    History of Present Illness, reviewed:  ***** presented to urgent care with three days of profuse ***** on 03/06/2018. At that time he was noted to have scleral icterus, and ***** to ***** ***** *****. Labs on presentation were notable for an elevated bilirubin of 3.5, AST 120, ALT 631,***** phos 261.

On second review of his initial biopsy, the specimen was thought to be insufficient for diagnosis. As such, another ERCP/***** performed on 04/04/18 with repeat FNA of the pancreatic mass. Pathology from this ***** scattered sheets and clusters of atypical glandular epithelium in a mucinous and bloody background, similar to prior FNA and consistent with a mucinous neoplasm, either IPMN or well differentiated adenocarcinoma. His course was complicated by post ERCP pancreatitis requiring a course *****.     He was seen for initial

Repeat EUS-***** his pancreatic head ***** hereby Dr. *****(GI)05/06/18 confirmed a diagnosis *****.We had originally referred him to I.R for consideration of percutaneous biopsy of this suspicious liver lesion, but this was felt not to be technically possible.    He initiated chemotherapy with ***** at full doses (minus the 5-***** bolus) beginning 05/15/2018, ***** 12cyclesin total through mid-October.***** cycle (#12)was administered with 20% dose reductions in both oxaliplatin and irinotecan due to grade 2 *****. ***** ***** his course of neoadjuvant ***** essentially stable disease.    He was taken to the O.R by Dr. ***** on 12/09/2018, where he underwent total pancreatectomy with portal vein ***** the left internal jugular vein. Final pathology demonstrated the following:  --------------------------  Tumor Location: Pancreatic head.  Procedure: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (***** procedure).  Size: Unifocal, 3.5 cm in greatest dimension.  Histologic Type: Invasive adenocarcinoma.  Histologic Grade of Invasive Carcinoma: Post-treatment tumor appears  well- to moderately differentiated.  Microscopic Tumor Extension: Tumor involves peripancreatic soft tissue  (slides A6, A28) and invades duodenal muscularis propria (slide A15).  Lymphovascular Invasion: Not identified.   Perineural Invasion: Present (slide A13).  Margins  Pancreatic Neck / 
 Pancreatic Duct Margin: Not applicable.  Uncinate (Retroperitoneal/***** ***** Artery) Margin: Negative  (2 mm from tumor, slide A6).  Proximal Pancreatic Parenchymal Margin: Not applicable.  Distal Pancreatic Parenchymal Margin: Not applicable.  Bile Duct Margin: Negative for tumor (slide A3). ***** acute  inflammation and reactive epithelial atypia. Away from the margin,  tumor surrounds the common bile duct.  Vein Margin: Negative for tumor (at least 3 mm from tumor, slides A1 and  A2).  Proximal Intestinal Margin (Gastric or Duodenal): Negative for tumor, at  least 1 cm from tumor, gross findings.  Distal Intestinal Margin (Distal Duodenal or Jejunal): Negative for  tumor, at least 1 cm from tumor, gross findings.  Other Margin(s): None.  Vascular groove surface: Tumor abuts vessel and is present less than 1  mm from surface (slide A9).  Posterior pancreatic surface: Negative for tumor, at least 5 mm from  tumor (slide A12)  Anterior pancreatic surface: Negative for tumor, at least 2 mm from  tumor (slide A11).  Treatment Effect:   Residual tumor on slide(s): A6, A8 through A15, *****.  ***** grading system (grade I-IV): Grade I, little (<10%) or no  tumor cell destruction.  Modified ***** scheme for tumor regression (score 0-3): Score 3, poor or  no response (extensive residual cancer with no evident tumor  regression).  ***** Lymph Nodes: Isolated tumor cells present in one lymph node.  Total number of nodes examined: 36.  Other Pathologic Findings: Background chronic pancreatitis and  high-grade PanIN.  AJCC 8th Edition Pathologic Stage: *****(i+) (Principles of Cancer  Staging, AJCC, 8th edition). Exocrine pancreas does not have a separate  reporting category for isolated tumor cells, so this may be considered  N1 disease based on clinical judgment by the managing physician.     The uncinate margin in slide A6 shows crushed foci of epithelial atypia  within walled structures, suggestive 
 of intravascular tumor growth.   However, areas of the main tumor mass such as A11 show similar  architectural properties, with malignant cells arranged in dilated  channels and surrounding by fibrous stroma. A6 shows mucin within a  lymph node, raising the possibility of lymph node spread.   Immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, or histochemical stains were  necessary to evaluate this case and establish the correct diagnosis.   The following stains were performed and evaluated at ***** on block A6:    - CD31: Highlights vascular endothelium, does not show intravascular  tumor. This focus is interpreted as invasive tumor in peripancreatic  soft tissue.   - Keratin: ***** single tumor cells and small clusters of cells less  than 0.2 mm in greatest diameter in association with mucin in a lymph  node. An additional H&E recut shows similar features. May represent  in-transit isolated tumor cells. This is an evolving area as far as  clinical significance.    MMR proteins all intact by IHC.  ---------------------------------------------  His postoperative course was notable for fevers of unclear etiology, rx'ed empirically with IV antibiotics/anti-fungal rx; a Hgb that ***** at 6.2 for which he received 2u PRBCs; and insulin ggt transitioned to a subcutaneous regimen prior to discharge.     He did require hospital re-admission from January 16 - 01/19/2019 due to abdominal pain.***** during this ***** a widely patent anastomosis,some mild inflammation around the anastamosis with no ulceration, ***** gastropathy. Biopsies were ***** no malignancy identified. He ***** on *****, a PPI, and triple therapy forH.pylori(although bx results showed no organisms).     CT scans performed during admission showed ***** ***** new 2.3 cm hepatic metastasis in segment 8, along with extensive peritoneal stranding and nodularity of indeterminate significance. 
 However, at the time of attempted biopsy (03/10/2019), this liver lesion was no longer discernible, and biopsy of the area showed only steatohepatitis in a background of moderate steatosis. Subsequent CT scans in June 2019 showed interval evolution of the liver lesion, now ***** in appearance and c/w posttreatment change or interval partial necrosis; as well as some interval increased soft tissue in the para-aortic region and at the celiac and SMA origins. At the time, he was also noted to have persistent transaminitis of indeterminate etiology (?possibly c/w steatohepatitis from ***** ***** chemotherapy; prior hepatitis B serologies negative), although his LFTs have come down since then, with only a slightly elevated AST.    Interval history/review of systems  Working part-time (self-owned catering and restaurant pop-ups); still with some easy fatiguability  No abdominal or back pain  Blood sugars well-controlled on current insulin regimen (fasting in low 100s)  Good appetite, uses enzyme supplements regularly with meals  BMs vary in consistency, up to 5-6x/day  Minimal residual peripheral sensory neuropathy from prior chemotherapy      Medications:  Lantus + humalog insulin  *****      Allergies/Contraindications  No Known Allergies      Comprehensive past medical, family, and social history which was performed during a previous encounter was re-examined and reviewed with the patient.

 evidence of metastatic disease within chest.      02/25/2021  CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  FINDINGS:  Liver:  Continued decrease in size of hepatic segment 8 lesion measuring 1.1 x 0.3 cm (series 303, image 22), previously 1.4 x 0.7 cm. Small pneumobilia, expected in the setting of the hepaticojejunostomy.    Gallbladder: Status post-cholecystectomy    Spleen:  Surgically absent.    Pancreas:  Status post total pancreatectomy. Increased ill-defined soft tissue surrounding the surgical clips anterior to the SMA measuring approximately 2.1 x 1.7 cm (series 303, image 54). Otherwise similar hazy soft tissue surrounding the celiac axis and portal confluence.     Adrenal Glands:  Unremarkable    Kidneys:  Unremarkable    GI Tract:  Status post duodenal resection.

Peritoneum: No ascites    Bladder: Unremarkable    Reproductive organs: Unremarkable    Bones:  No suspicious lesions    Extraperitoneal soft tissues: Unremarkable    Lines/drains/medical devices: None    IMPRESSION:   1.  Compared to 06/14/2020, increased ill-defined soft tissue measuring up to 2.1 x 1.7 cm surrounding the surgical clips anterior to the SMA, concerning for locally recurrent disease. Further evaluation with PET/CT may be helpful for confirmation.    2.  Similar appearance of small retroperitoneal lymph nodes.    3.  Continued decrease in size of hepatic segment 8 lesion.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 37 y.o. male now approx 18 months s/p total pancreatectomy(December 2018)for a node-positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma, following 12 cycles of neoadjuvant ***** w/o significant pathologic response.    Postoperative CT scans have been notable for a hepatic lesion concerning for possible metastasis, not confirmed on f/u imaging and attempted biopsy, and now resolving; as well as soft-tissue findings 
 near the operative bed that do seem to be increasing on most recent imaging. This latter finding represents some concern for locoregional recurrence; I would like to evaluate further with an EUS/biopsy (if technically feasible). If a local relapse is confirmed, I would favor treating with a course of concurrent *****.    Other issues:  - His post-pancreatectomy endocrine and exocrine insufficiency are being managed with an insulin regimen (encouraged follow up with Endocrinology) and regular use of enzyme supplements with meals, respectively.   - He continues to have a slight transaminitis of indeterminate etiology, most likely c/w steatohepatitis from ***** ***** chemotherapy; we will continue to monitor *****.  - The patient does have a pathogenic germline mutation in *****, detected on Myriad Genetics panel testing, and he has been seen at our Hereditary Cancer clinic. Somatic findings from his tumor show ***** (*****) and ATM mutations.    All of the patient's questions were answered *****.        Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient has a recently resected cancer that remains at high risk of relapse and requires close surveillance.

142,Male,Asian,1956-09-14,"ATTENDING: ***** *****, MD     PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Mr. ***** is a 62 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his diagnosis of  borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma due to <180 degrees of vascular involvement.    ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:   Patient has a past medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes. He was in his usual state of health until mid May 2019 when he developed sudden abdominal pain which prompted him to present to the ER. In the ER he was diagnosed with pancreatitis due to an elevated lipase and a CT scan showing possible minimal peripancreatic fat stranding which may relate to mild acute pancreatitis. He was eventually referred to gastroenterology to follow up on this episode of pancreatitis out of the blue who recommended an EUS evaluate for any pancreatic ductal abnormalities, small tumors or microlithiasis.    *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: OSH ED with RUQ abdominal pain. Markedly elevated LFTs and dilated biliary tree. ERCP + EUS + biopsy was done and revealed the following: a 2 cm mass was identified in the genu of the pancreas compressing the mid bile duct and ***** the portal confluence.

Gallbladder: Unremarkable Spleen:  Unremarkable Pancreas:  Similar appearance of locally advanced pancreatic cancer which encases the celiac axis and branches as well as the superior mesenteric artery, as described vascular section. Exact dimensions of the masses difficult given its infiltrative nature, however it measures approximately 3.5 x 4.7 cm in the AP and transverse dimensions. Adrenal Glands:  Similar left adrenal gland thickening. Kidneys:  Unremarkable GI Tract:  Diffuse thickening of the ascending colon, similar to multiple prior examinations. This may relate to edema/venous congestion from portal occlusion. Vasculature:  Similar appearance of occluded main portal vein with cavernous transformation. Again seen is attenuated appearance of the encased portion of the splenic artery. Additional celiac axis branches are not seen and may be occluded as a result of surrounding tumor invasion.

144,Male,Asian,1953-08-07,"Mr. ***** is a 64 y.o. male who comes to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in consultation for his resected pancreatic cancer. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all his outside records.    History of Present Illness  This pleasant gentleman is from ***** ***** has received all of his care to date there. He initially presented last March with weight loss, nausea, abdominal pain, and scleral icterus and was found on laboratory tests to have elevated LFTs, including a total bilirubin of 7.4, AST/ALT of 624 and 661 respectively, and an alk phos of 447. Imaging studies included MRCP (04/18/2017), showing a focal mass lesion in head and uncinate process of the pancreas (46x26 mm) obstructing the lower end intrapancreatic portion of CBD and MPD; and CT scan(04/21/2017) confirming a 3.3x2.5x3.8 cm mass in the pancreatic head causing both pancreatic and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with suggestion of SMV invasion.     He was taken directly to surgery on 04/24/2017, consisting of a classical pancreaticoduodenectomy (*****) on 04/24/2017. Final pathology revealed a 2.2x2.1x2 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative margins and 0 of 9 involved LNs.    Post-operative course was notable for an intraabdominal abscess requiring percutaneous drainage. He was eventually discharged home on 05/15/2017, tolerating limited oral nutrition (some rice and soup) but also receiving supplemental feeds via an enteral feeding tube (600ml/day).      He was eventually able to start on adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of single-agent gemcitabine on 06/11/2017 originally intended to be given on a three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule; however, this was subsequently switched to a two-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule due to cytopenias and for better tolerability. He has now completed 5 cycles, with his most recent dose in ***** administered on 
 09/10/2017.    The patient's present review of systems was reviewed and notable for the following:  - Some cumulative fatigue a/w treatment; still independent with ADLs  - No nausea, but some dysgeusia causing diminished appetite  - ~5 kg down from baseline, but now stable  - Constipation following each chemotherapy infusion; uses laxatives regularly  - Blood sugars reasonably well controlled on current insulin regimen, although does get in the 200s range in the AM  - No urinary difficulties  - No angina/cardiac symptoms  - No abdominal pain  - No febrile complications during chemotherapy  - Mild chronic dry cough  - Chronic loss of hearing in R ear (following ear infection in 2016)  - Some L UE neuropathy since surgery  - Moderate hair loss  - No evidence of depression or psychosis    The remainder of a full review of systems was negative.

Pathology: ***** testing performed here showed only ***** and ***** mutations; no microsatellite instability.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 64 y.o. male from *****, now 5 months s/p ***** resection of a node-negative pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He is currently in the midst of his course of adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine (simplified schedule-wise to a two-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule), which I affirmed is an entirely appropriate treatment strategy and which he appears to be tolerating adequately thus far. Given his margin-negative surgery, as well as the debatable role of adjuvant radiation for resected pancreatic cancer, I would not recommend RT in his particular circumstances.    We will resume his care while he is here in the United States with the same dose and schedule of chemotherapy, beginning next week (09/24/2017). He will receive 2 treatment cycles here, and then return to ***** ***** his planned final cycle (#8).     I discussed at length with him and his family ancillary/supportive care measures during this time, in terms of diet and exercise; we reviewed and simplified his medication list; and we talked about plans for long-term monitoring after completion of his adjuvant therapy, as well as his overall prognosis. All of their questions were answered to their satisfaction.

145,Female,Asian,1949-09-07,"VIDEO VISIT  I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.    Ms. ***** is a 72 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her her metastatic pancreatic cancer.    History of Present Illness, reviewed:  Ms. ***** was originally diagnosed in late 2020 after presenting with obstructive jaundice symptoms and lightheadedness. Laboratory evaluation (10/03/2020 showed elevated LFTs, including a tot bili of 6.8. CT scans on that same day showed an ill-defined solid mass in the pancreatic head and uncinate process measuring3.6 x 4.8 cm, ***** proximal main portal ***** ***** superior mesenteric vein resulting in mild narrowing.    She underwent EUS/ERCP on 10/08/2020, with placement of a plastic ***** stent (subsequently exchanged for a metallic one) and biopsy of *****.5 X 33.5mmisoechoic mass in the pancreatic head confirming adenocarcinoma. Repeat imaging (CT C/A/P) on 10/24/2020, in addition to the primary pancreatic head mass, demonstrated a hypodense hepatic segment 8 lesion measuring up to 1.7 cm(previously noted to measure 0.3 cm), and ***** 1.2 x 1.8 cm right adrenal nodule concerning for metastatic disease.     The patient ultimately initiated chemotherapy consisting ofthe combination of gemcitabine plus *****-***** ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle)beginning 11/22/2020. Repeat imaging s/***** treatment cycles ***** stable disease. She did also have treatment-related anemia (Hgb dropping as low as 6.7 in early January, for which she received 2u PRBCs, with no signs/symptoms of active GI 
 bleeding; Hgb's stable since then).     She continued on the same regimen with a dose reduction in her *****-paclitaxel by 20% for better tolerability, and repeat imaging after 4 and again after 6 cycles in total ***** stable disease, aside from a very marginal increase in her mesenteric lymphadenopathy. On this basis, she stopped treatment (last dose = 04/30/2021) and I referred her to Rad Onc for ***** to her pancreatic primary, which she received (33 Gy x 5 fractions) between 06/10/2021and 06/20/2021.    She was hospitalized at ***** campus from September 22 -09/25/2021 for symptomatic anemia (Hgb 5.8). In addition to PRBC transfusions and temporary holding of her Xarelto, she underwent EGD (09/24/2021) which showed evidence of scattered radiation gastritis, treated with ***** Plasma Coagulation; as well as a 1.5 cm ulcer in the pyloric channel, treated with gold probe cautery. Updated CT imaging is detailed below.     Since her last visit with me 2 weeks ago, we have done the following:  - Transfused 2u PRBC for recurrent anemia (Hgb down to 8.1 vs 11.9 at time of hospital discharge), c/w slow GI bleed  - Referred back to ***** for endoscopic evaluation of bleed, plus new-onset LFT abnormalities (tot bili 2.1, AST/ALT *****/*****)  - 10/10/2021: EGD notable for 1.5cm, ***** ulcer in pyloric channel, clean based with no stigmata of bleeding. Bx at edge negative for malignancy. ***** could not be advanced beyond duodenal sweep due to luminal narrowing and anatomical distortion, thus ERCP could not be undertaken. EUS-guided celiac plexus block performed for palliation.  - 10/17/2021: Repeat endoscopic procedure; gastrojejunostomy created using 15mm x ***** ***** stent. No good windows found for choledochoduodenostomy, although by this time the patient's LFTs had normalized.  - 11/03/2021: Initiated *****, minus the 5FU bolus  - 11/19/2021: Admitted to ***** campus for acute on chronic LUQ pain, 
 bloody stools x 1. Hgb ***** at 6.6, for which she was tx'ed with 2u PRBCs. EGD notable for the following: 1. The duodenum was mildly edematous with some distortion of the lumen. BIliary stent appeared to be pressing against the ***** wall of the duodenum with an area of ulceration but no visible bleeding or blood vessel. There were a few tiny ***** in the duodenum likely from prior radiation. APC was performed at 15 Watts of two small spots in the duodenum. 2. The previously visualized pyloric channel ulcer was still present, clean based with no visible vessel or bleeding. In the antrum there was a small amount of ***** likely from prior radiation, treated with APC at 15 watts with good effect. 3. The previously placed gastrojejunostomy stent was in place and patent. 4. The mucosa of the esophagus appeared normal.    The patient was otherwise managed symptomatically, with her anticoagulation changed from ***** to Apixaban. D/c'ed to home on 11/21/2021. Did require additional 1u PRBC on 11/27/2021 for Hgb of 8.2 and another episode of bloody stools.    She was then readmitted to ***** on 12/04/2021 for hypotension, hematemesis; rx'ed with FFP, 2u PRBCs, octreotide, IV protonix. Also underwent CT angiogram of the brain/neck due to slurred speech/R UE motor weakness, found to have L precentral gyrus CVA. D/c'ed to home on 12/07/2021.    - 12/24/2021: Discussed at ***** ***** clinic visit her GoC given her marginal functional status to consider further cancer treatment. Ultimately enrolled on home hospice, but this was revoked so she could undergo repeat CT scans and receive additional supportive care at our infusion center    - Repeat imaging (CT scans 01/16/2022) with stable 1o pancreatic mass, no evidence of progression.    - Due to gradually worsening abdominal pain, repeat CT scans (non-contrast) were performed on 04/13/2022, with stable to minimal progression in her pancreatic head 
 mass.    - Repeat CT scans, this time with IV contrast (06/03/2022) detailed below, notable for ongoing disease stability.    On present review of systems, Ms. ***** notes:  - Generalized fatigue and dizziness. She remains fairly sedentary and now needs some assistance with ADLs.  - Repeat celiac plexus block performed on 04/09/2022, with minimal improvement. On combination of short- and long-acting morphine.  - Appetite is sluggish, with frequent postprandial vomiting.  - (+) constipation; had hard BM yesterday for first time in a week, with no melena or other signs of GI bleeding   - Continues on her Eliquis under the advice of her PCP (for CVA prophylaxis).    - She notes no jaundice symptoms.

Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 72 y.o. female with metastatic *****,s/***** chemotherapy consisting ofthe combination of gemcitabine plus *****-***** ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) x 6 treatment cycles (with a 20% dose reduction in *****-paclitaxel beginning cycle #3), with good disease control. Thereafter, given relatively limited metastatic disease, she received a course of ***** to her pancreatic primary for local control (June 2021). She has been monitored since that time w/o further treatment.    Her disease course since then has been notable for:  - Chronic GI blood loss related to a bleeding pyloric ulcer/radiation gastritis, +/- 
 malignant infiltration of her primary pancreatic tumor, requiring multiple PRBC transfusions. Maintained on PPI therapy.  - EUS-guided celiac plexus block x 2 (on 10/10/2021, repeated on 04/09/2022)  - Gastric outlet obstruction, s/p GJ stent placement on 10/17/2021  - Transient jaundice/LFT abnormalities, since spontaneously resolving  - A single dose of ***** beginning in late October 2021  - ***** precentral gyrus CVA, with slight residual neurologic deficits  - Briefly started on home hospice before ***** this to be able to receive further monitoring and intervention PRN.     We reviewed her most recent imaging studies which show continued non-progression of her disease, with a stable primary pancreatic mass and no visible evidence of active/progressive metastatic disease. We again had a discussion re: the role and indication for chemotherapy, and why I would not recommend such treatment given her ongoing disease control and poor risk/benefit balance in the face of her overall frailty/marginal functional status.  I do think at some point it will be of great advantage to re-establish home hospice services, when she shows evidence of either/both clinical and/or radiographic disease progression.    Other issues:  - Prior results from ***** ***** molecular profiling show MSS, TMB = 0 muts/Mb, a ***** ***** mutation, and ***** splice site mutation.  - Pain management: aside from her celiac plexus blocks x 2, she has been on a combination of long- and short-acting morphine with suboptimal pain control. She has not yet tried the Fentanyl transdermal patch which I previously prescribed for her. Given sensitivity to opioids and concern re: side fx, I will refer to our Pain management team for further titration and oversight.  - GI bleeding: Continue on PPI rx and carafate. No recent events.  - Anticoagulation (for PAF and CVA prophylaxis): Back on Eliquis w/o suggestion of recurrent GI bleed. However, given (symptomatic) 
 anemia, will arrange for PRBC transfusion.  - s/p GJ stent appears patent, w/o evidence of obstruction; however, the patient is experiencing increased postprandial vomiting which raises some concern. We talked about endoscopic evaluation which she is somewhat reluctant to pursue but will take time to decide.    All of the patient's questions were answered ***** *****'s satisfaction with a video Cantonese interpreter. We will follow up again in another ~3-4 weeks' time, with further imaging dictated by the family's request primarily for prognostic purposes. I would have a low threshold for hospital admission if she cannot thrive at home.       Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High.

US DOPPLER UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS, BILATERAL:  10/19/2016   FINDINGS: The bilateral  upper extremity deep veins including the internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, cephalic, brachial, and basilic veins are patent with normal flow patterns. No deep venous thrombosis is present. Soft tissues are unremarkable.     1. Negative for DVT in the bilateral  upper extremity.     US DOPPLER LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS, BILATERAL:  10/19/2016   FINDINGS:   Multiple transverse and longitudinal high resolution sonograms of the bilateral lower extremities were obtained in conjunction with compression techniques, augmentation, duplex, and color doppler sonography.  The common femoral, femoral (formerly referred to as the superficial femoral vein), popliteal, anterior and posterior tibial, and peroneal veins (through the mid calf) display normal *****, and normal Doppler augmentation and flow. No evidence for deep vein thrombosis in these vessels was identified. Soft tissues are unremarkable.     Negative examination for deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower extremities from the common femoral vein through the mid calf.       Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 75 y.o. female with advanced (at least locally advanced, more likely metastatic) pancreatic adenocarcinoma, s/p a single dose of palliative chemotherapy with the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel > 1 month ago, since admitted to the hospital x 2 for general failure to thrive, anorexia, and diarrhea.    I had a frank goals of care discussion with her and her family. At this point, it 
 appears that the risk:benefit ratio of pursuing further chemotherapy is unfavorable and I would strongly recommend against this. Similarly, I do not see palliative radiation (including *****) as offering any benefit in this scenario. Her family may wish her to try some acupuncture and/or Chinese herbs which I think would be fine. Otherwise, we will refocus our goals on purely palliative/symptomatic measures with a referral to home hospice, given that her expected longevity is likely measurable in weeks at this point.    For now, I will prescribe her low-dose Decadron as an appetite stimulant, and have her receive a liter of IV fluids at our infusion center today.    I spent a total of 30 minutes face-to-face with the patient, of which greater than 50% was spent in counseling regarding her cancer diagnosis.

148,Male,Asian,1934-06-05,"Mr. ***** is a 79 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his localized pancreatic cancer, originally diagnosed in May 2013 after presenting with obstructive jaundice. Despite potentially resectable disease, the decision has been made to defer on surgery due to his advanced age and high operative risk.     He started on chemotherapy with alternating-week schedule of gemcitabine (800 mg/m2) plus capecitabine (650 mg/m2 BID), beginning on 08/25/2013 (28 day cycles). Treatment was initially complicated by several hospitalizations due to ascending cholangitis/bacteremia; he does have a metallic stent as well as bilateral plastic ***** stents in place which are periodically exchanged. His capecitabine was ultimately held beginning midway through cycle 4a of treatment, and he continued with single-agent gemcitabine administered on a ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 q28 days) through cycle #6 in February 2014.     After that point, I referred him to our Rad Onc faculty practice for consideration of consolidation (chemo)RT, including possibly *****, but the decision was made to defer on this given the absence of radiographically measurable disease.     Also of note, the patient was admitted to ***** campus from 6.4 through 04/30/2014 due to progressive hypoxia at home, and the more acute development of fevers/rigors and altered mental status. Inpatient evaluation included fairly unremarkable CT scans (see below), echocardiogram showing normal LV function, and Pulmonary evaluation with identification of restrictive pulmonary physiology (? kyphoscoliosis plus generalized weakness, other etiology?), improved with use of BiPAP. He was also hospitalized at end of May for mental status changes a/w poorly controlled HTN; brain MRI suggests some amyloid angiopathy.      The patient has now been off all therapy for the past 5 months. On present review of 
 systems, he notes:  - Good appetite, gaining weight  - Minimal abdominal pain, but chronic R hip/lower back pain limits mobility  - Home O2 dependent; breathing comfortably, no chronic cough  - (+) constipation  - Blood sugars in 100s-300s on current insulin regimen  - No recent fevers/colds  - Mild chronic LE edema bilaterally  - No jaundice symptoms  - Occasional urinary dribbling  - Normal mentation at present  The remainder of the patient's review of systems was negative.

His disease in fact remains difficult to measure/monitor at present, now off treatment for the past 5 months. We discussed the following issues and plan at today's visit:     - No indication for continued/'maintenance' chemotherapy at this point     - No role at present for RT although this could be considered in the future in the face of locoregional progression; patient is clearly not an appropriate operative candidate 
 given his tenuous clinical/pulmonary status and multiple medical co-morbidities     - Patient clearly not a surgical candidate given his multiple medical comorbidities.    - Continue with regular ***** stent exchanges. He currently has one metallic and two plastic ones in his bilateral ductal systems; will discuss with GI re: whether additional metallic stents may be possible at his next procedure given that patient is higher-than-average risk.    - F/u with Neurology (amyloid angiopathy) and Pulmonary Medicine/    - Plan repeat CT scan, labs inc *****-9 again in 4-6 months' time, with f/u visit with me thereafter.

There is linear low-attenuation along the falciform ligament adjacent to the left portal vein with the distal left portal vein being diminutive in size. This appears unchanged since prior exam and may be related to compression or partial thrombosis of a branch of the left portal vein.  Gallbladder: Unremarkable 
 Spleen: Unremarkable Pancreas: No significant change in the hypoattenuating necrotic pancreatic mass in the pancreatic body that measures approximately 4.0 x 3.2 cm in transaxial dimension. The mass encases and obliterates the proximal celiac artery and partially encases the superior mesenteric artery. The mass partially encases and significantly narrows the superior mesenteric vein and there is complete occlusion of the splenic vein. The main portal vein is patent but significantly narrowed at the ***** confluence. There is a marked amount of venous congestion in the pelvis due to the significant superior mesenteric vein narrowing. There is atrophy of the pancreatic tail. The common bile duct is nondilated.

No significant change in size of the pancreatic body and tail necrotic mass. The mass is resulting in severe narrowing of the superior mesenteric vein and obliteration of the splenic vein. The celiac axis is completely encased and obstructed in its proximal portion.  //ALERT// 2. New ill-defined low attenuating lesion in segment 6 of the liver is concerning for metastatic disease.  3. There is circumferential gastric antral wall thickening which may be secondary to gastritis.         Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** appears to be doing well with her current chemotherapy regimen consisting of an alternating-week schedule of gemcitabine plus capecitabine for her advanced pancreatic cancer. She maintains a good ***** overall and her *****-9 biomarker has been declining. I went over in careful detail the radiographic findings from her recent CT with one of our radiologists, and 
 the segment 6 liver lesion is very subtle and by no means definitive for a hepatic metastasis. I went over these results with the patient and her family, and my recommendation is to continue the course with no change in her current regimen, based on other evidence suggesting a favorable response. We will continue to monitor her *****-9 levels and plan for a repeat CT scan after an additional 2 cycles of treatment, sooner should there be any earlier suggestion of disease progression.    The patient and her family understand and are in agreement with the plan. F/u has been scheduled with me again in 4 weeks' time, prior to the scheduled start of cycle #4.

Multiple pulmonary nodules, not significantly changed from most recent comparison on 05/07/2021, though demonstrating slight increase in size compared to more remote exams.  3.  Subacute posterolateral right ninth rib and anterolateral left sixth rib fractures, new since prior exam on 05/07/2021. Correlate with interval history of trauma.      CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  FINDINGS:  Liver:  Unchanged hepatic cysts. Subcentimeter hypoattenuating foci in the liver are unchanged and too small to characterize. Persistent pneumobilia, which is expected in the setting of hepaticojejunostomy.    Gallbladder: Status post cholecystectomy.    Spleen:  Unremarkable    Pancreas:  Similar postsurgical changes from ***** procedure. Ill-defined aortocaval soft tissue is described below.

Ill-defined aortocaval soft tissue which has gradually enlarged since 02/19/2021 is concerning for  mildly worsening local tumor recurrence.       2.  No new evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen or pelvis.        Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 62 y.o. male now almost 4 years s/p ***** resection of a stage II (pT2N1) adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head (September 2017).After a period of delay due to a variety of social/logistic circumstances, he initiated adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of single-agent gemcitabine, completing his first cycle w/o incident. Then, based on postoperative radiographic findings concerning if not absolutely definitive for the development of hepatic metastases (not biopsy-able), we opted to expand his chemotherapy regimen to the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel,originally on a three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule and subsequently switched to a ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) due to cytopenias. He completed 6 treatment cycles in total, through July 2018.    Repeat ***** of these hepatic lesions;suspicious but not definitive tiny (sub-cm) pulmonary nodules; and biopsy-proven recurrence in the operative bed, for which he completed a course of IMRT in September/October 2020.    We ***** recent imaging studies noting 
 in particular the reassuring non-progression in his pulmonary nodules; but slight interval increase in the extent of his soft tissue abnormality near the operative bed, concerning but not definitive for progression in this previously irradiated area.  I do note his elevated *****-9 levels suggestive of active indolent disease, but would not use this alone as a basis for immediately resuming systemic therapy, although we will need to consider this possibility in the future. For now, we agreed to continue with a course of monitoring/expectant management w/o treatment, with plans on repeat imaging and bloodwork in another ~3 months' time.    Mr. ***** understands and is in agreement with the plan.      Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient's cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Data elements reviewed: 3+ (CT scans, bloodwork including CBC, LFTs, and creat)

151,Male,Unknown/Declined,1953-08-30,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Interested in management options for metastatic adenocarcinoma    REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  Patient is self-referred    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a very pleasant 58-year-old African American from ***** *****.  He presented with left flank pain in September of last year and was found at that time to have bilateral adrenal adenomas.  During his workup, he was also noted to have an elevated PSA of 5.1.  Eventually a biopsy was done of the prostate and this revealed a stage II, T2 *****., ***** score 7 lesion.  A prostatectomy was recommended.    At some point during this workup, was appreciated that he had a mass in the body of the pancreas measuring 6.5 x 2.5 x 2.4 cm.  No extrahepatic disease was identified.  A PET/CT was also done on March 09 which showed some increase in the left supraclavicular lymph nodes as well as uptake in the prostate and in the pancreas.  There was no evidence of intra-abdominal metastases.  At ***** of the pancreas was done on March 03 which revealed an adenocarcinoma.  A diagnostic laparoscopy was done on March 22.  This showed multiple metastases along the right diaphragmatic surface and biopsies were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. Bone scan showed changes consistent with arthritic or degenerative changes in the sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joints.    He was seen at ***** for medical oncology consultation.  Treatment with either gemcitabine monotherapy or modified ***** was recommended.  A clinical trial was also discussed.    Symptomatically, he is doing well.  Initial pain that he had in the left flank actually resolved shortly after its appearance.  His weight is been stable.  He has a good appetite.  He has normal bowel movements.  He is doing all of his usual activities.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  See below    MEDICAL ILLNESSES:  He has had diabetes for 2 years and became insulin-dependent a year ago.  He's had hypertension since 1996.

ALLERGIES:  Allergies   Allergen Reactions    Januvia (Sitagliptin) Other (See Comments)     Pt does not want this medication prescribed due to loose associations with pancreatic cancer.    Metformin Nausea And Vomiting       FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother died at the age of 44 from either uterine or ovarian cancer.  She had 9 siblings and is not aware of any cancers among them.  He himself has 11 siblings and one sister died from colon cancer at the age of 58.  Many family members have had diabetes and some of died from complications of diabetes.  His father never had a cancer diagnosis.    SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has no history of tobacco use and he does not drink.  He ***** ***** ***** ***** company he manages a claims department.  His wife is a pharmacist.  They've been married for 23 years and have 3 sons.    ROS:   In addition to symptoms discussed above in ***** of Present Illness, the patient's review of systems was reviewed and notable for the following:    Constitutional: no fevers, chills, night sweats; no recent weight loss. Appetite 
 intact.  *****: no visual disturbances, including blurry vision or diplopia.  ENT: no hearing disturbances, no taste changes.  Respiratory: no shortness of breath or cough.  Cardiovasc: no chest pressure or pain; no palpitations.  Gastrointestinal: Regular daily bowel movements. No constipation or diarrhea. No rectal bleeding or melena. No abdominal pain.   GU: No dysuria or hematuria.  Skin: no rashes or lesions. No notable hair loss.  Musculoskeletal: no myalgias or *****.  Neuro: no headaches, seizures, or focal sensorimotor deficits.  Psych: no reported symptoms of depression or psychosis.    The remainder of a full review of systems was negative.    PE:    Vitals: BP 139/84 | Pulse 79 | Temp(Src) 36.7 C (98.1 F) (Oral) | Resp 18 | Ht 180 cm (5' 10.87"") | Wt 84.596 kg (186 lb 8 oz) | BMI 26.11 kg/m2 | SpO2 98%   In general, he appears comfortable.

IMAGING:  No images are attached to the encounter.    CT images from ***** are reviewed and interpreted.  Findings are confirmatory to outside reports    ASSESSMENT:  1. Metastatic adenocarcinoma to pancreas  2. Stage II prostate cancer  3.  Possible inherited cancer family syndrome  4.  ECOG 0    RECOMMENDATION:  I spent 60 minutes in face-to-face consultation with the patient and his wife going overall aspects of his care and management.  He understands that he does not have a curable malignancy and that our best hope is to manage it as a chronic disease for as long as possible.  Because of a possible underlying genetic susceptibility, I favor treatment 
 with a DNA damaging agent.  Therefore I would elect to offer him modified *****. He will need to have a port placed.    I do think that we can put his stage II prostate cancer on the back ***** and revisit it when we understand whether we can achieve control of his metastatic pancreatic cancer.  He is still trying to decide whether he would like to have his care UCSF and will get back to us about that.    We did give him a referral to our genetic risk program.

152,Female,Other,1964-03-18,"Subjective:    This is a very pleasant 50-year-old woman with the aforementioned diagnosis.  *****, her mother was under our care for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Her mother had been doing well but suddenly developed sepsis and a bowel perforation and died just prior to her daughter's diagnosis.    The patient's diagnosis was triggered by the symptoms of dyspepsia that were triggered by food.  This started about a month ago.  She's also had a few months of unexplained weight loss, which she thought might be due to stress.  She had also noticed early satiety and had back pain that radiated to her abdomen.  She was also fatigued.    CT scan dated March 03 showed a mass involving the pancreatic head encasing the proximal celiac axis and region of the portal mesenteric confluent.  This was confirmed on EUS on March 16 at which time a fine needle aspirate was done confirming adenocarcinoma.    When we initially saw her, she appeared to have impending biliary duct obstruction.  We referred her for an ERCP and she was also found to have some threat of obstruction in the duodenum. We also repeated her CT scan and this again confirmed locally advanced disease.    We then started treatment with modified *****. She completed 12 cycles. She initially did not not tolerate it well. However, we reduced her doses across the board and this helped a lot. She then went on surveillance. During this time, she required placement of a duodenal stent.    We saw her in December, she clearly had progressing disease with new ascites. She also had tumor ingrowth in her duodenal stent requiring placement of a new stent within the stent.    We then started gemcitabine and Abraxane. She's had one full cycle. She is tolerating therapy reasonably well. Her appetite is variable. She's lost 14 pounds. She is quite constipated from her narcotics but can get relief with senna and docusate sodium.    Her pain is not optimally controlled. 
 She is on fentanyl 100 mcg but is taking 6-8 tablets per day of immediate release morphine, 15 mg.    She denies any symptoms of neuropathy. She occasionally takes Decadron for nausea. She has experienced alopecia.      Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.

153,Male,Asian,1944-10-06,"Mr. ***** is a 70 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his metastatic pancreatic cancer, originally diagnosed in March 2013 after presenting with progressive abdominal discomfort. CT scan at that time demonstrated a 3.9 cm pancreatic tail necrotic mass, extending into the splenic hilum and abutting the stomach, with surrounding stranding in the fat which extends toward the L kidney and splenic flexure of the colon; with encasement of the splenic artery. Also noted were adjacent LNs 9 mm in size; cystic liver lesions up to 3.6 cm in size; small free fluid in the pelvis with pelvic/peritoneal nodules up to 1.4 cm in size; nodular thickening along greater curvature of the stomach; and L ureteral obstruction 2o to a 2.3 cm retroperitoneal nodule causing moderate hydronephrosis. Endoscopic FNA of the pancreatic mass on 03/27/2013 confirmed adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent ureteral stent placement on 03/28/2013.     Initial treatment consisted of *****, to which he responded well with interval imaging demonstrating reduction in both his primary tumor and measurable distant sites of disease. However, he did develop some cumulative cytopenias and peripheral sensory neuropathy ultimately requiring holding of the oxaliplatin beginning with cycle #6. He then continued with ***** alone, with an eventual spacing of his dosing schedule to q3 weeks. Between the ***** and the *****, he completed 18 cycles in total through February 2014.     Following his initial consultation with me in February 2014, I suggested he meet Dr. ***** of our Surgical faculty practice to discuss his surgical options, given the absence of measurable metastatic disease on his most recent CT scans and excellent durable disease control. Repeat imaging here at ***** on 05/22/2014 confirmed only the presence of an ill-defined hypodense pancreatic tail mass measuring approximately 2.0 
 cm, without measurable disease elsewhere in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. However, the ultimate decision at ***** ***** ***** was not to pursue a surgical approach, given the extent of his peritoneal disease preoperatively.     He was on a chemotherapy holiday for 8 months, with serial imaging showing relatively stable disease but the patient noting some increasing abdominal pain toward the end of 2014. On this basis, he restarted chemotherapy with ***** in October 2014 and received 9 cycles in total. Most recent CT scans on 03/03/2015 showed minimal change/slight enlargement in his pancreatic tail mass, extending into the stomach, L kidney, proximal descending colon, and splenic hilum, with splenic vein occlusion/gastric varices; as well as stable sub-cm peritoneal metastases.    At the last visit we discussed various options for further treatment, including immunotherapy-based clinical trials. The patient is interested in the possibility of participating in a clinical trial and returns today to discuss this further. He has not received any further chemotherapy in the meantime.    Interval history/review of systems  - Feeling well overall, no major complaints  - Staying active, playing tennis and riding his bike regularly (ECOG PS 0)  - Appetite reasonably well-maintained, weight stable  - Abdominal pain had initially disappeared when he resumed chemotherapy, although more recently he notes occasional bilateral subcostal discomfort, for which he has just restarted taking hydrocodone within the last week.  - Some residual peripheral sensory neuropathy from original *****, unchanged  - No fevers/chills, cough, SOB, rash, dysuria, N/V/D.    Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.   Medication Sig    amLODIPine-valsartan (EXFORGE) 10-320 mg tablet Take 1 tablet by mouth Daily.    dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) 60 mg ***** ***** ***** Take 60 mg by mouth Daily.    LORazepam (ATIVAN) 0.5 mg

We appreciate a persistent pancreatic tail mass, lower abdominal peritoneal metastases, and multiple new scattered pulmonary nodules most likely representing new pulmonary metastatic disease, sub-cm in size.    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 70 y.o. male with metastatic ***** diagnosed 2 years ago, s/p front-line therapy consisting of ***** --> simplified to *****, which he has received for a prolonged period (including two separate courses of *****) with relatively minimal progression radiographically. He has been off of chemotherapy now since the end of February and while he maintains an excellent ***** overall with relatively minimal symptoms and overall low burden of disease, he is showing modest disease progression. We discussed his various options at this point, not including resuming *****/***** which remain a viable possibility.    (a) SOC treatment with a gemcitabine-based regimen, such as the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel  (b) a randomized phase II trial of CRS-207, an attenuated mesothelin-expressing Listeria vaccine, with or without *****, vs standard single-agent chemotherapy (which in case I would opt for gemcitabine) -- currently open and *****;  (c) a randomized phase II trial of the aforementioned CRS-207/***** combination +/- the anti-PD1 mAb nivolumab (to be open w/i next 1-2 weeks); or  (d) a randomized phase II trial of ACP-196 (a BTK inhibitor) +/- the anti-PD1 mAb pembrolizumab (not yet open).     After much consideration and discussion re: the above, including logistics and the randomized trial designs, he would like some time to consider the above clinical trial options, in particular options (b) and (c).  Given that the trial of CRS-207/***** 
 combination +/- nivolumab (option c) is scheduled to open in the coming weeks, and does not contain a chemo-only randomization arm, Mr. ***** is somewhat attracted to this option. He is, however, hesitant about the required biopsy for entry into this trial, of which we would likely obtain the biopsy from one of his peritoneal metastases. We have gone ahead and placed an interventional radiology consult to have the IR team evaluate whether this would be a viable strategy.     The patient has our contact information and will let us know how he would like to proceed. Once we hear from him, we will arrange for further screening for eligibility and likely starting within the next few weeks.    Of note, his labs today were notable for pyuria on UA. He did not report any dysuria or f/c, and therefore we have ordered a repeat UA and urine culture for his next visit to re-evaluate.      I spent a total of 35 minutes face-to-face with the patient, of which greater than 50% was spent in counseling regarding his cancer diagnosis.    ATTESTATION:      My date of service is 04/21/2015.  I was present for and performed key portions of an examination of the patient and am personally involved in his management. I agree with the findings and care plans as documented.     ***** ***** *****, MD  PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL MEDICINE  GASTROINTESTINAL ONCOLOGY

154,Male,Asian,1958-06-25,"Follow Up    Mr. ***** is a 62 y.o. male whom I am seeing as a video visit at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his metastatic pancreaticobiliary cancer with radiographic evidence of liver lesions    Oncologic History:  Pt initially developed right upper abdominal pain and jaundice (bilirubin 6) in March 2015, for which an US was obtained and showed a dilated CBD with a mass in the upper duct. There was associated intrahepatic ductal dilatation with decompression of the duct more distally. There was cholelithiasis with stones lodged in or near the gallbladder neck.  An MRCP on 04/27/15 showed moderate to severe intrahepatic ductal dilatation secondary to tubular inner luminal filling defect over 3 cm long over 1.5 cm in diameter gallbladder appeared to be collapse of the were several small stones the distal common bile duct was of normal caliber for the last 2-3 cm liver showed no lesions pancreas appeared to be normal along with spleen liver and kidneys. ERCP in ***** on 04/30/15 which showed biliary obstruction in the lower third of the main duct, s/p placement of a plastic stent, and brushings demonstrated adenocarcinoma consistent with a bile duct primary.      On the basis of this finding, and a reported diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, he was referred to *****, and underwent a bile duct resection, pancreas biopsy, cholecystectomy and hepaticojejunostomy on 05/12/15 (Dr. *****).  Intraoperatively, he was found to have several nodules in the omentum, with pathology showing chronic inflammation.  Biopsies from the pancreas also showed chronic inflammation (reactive fibroadipose tissue with organizing fat necrosis, no parenchyma or tumor identified).  ***** from the common bile duct bifurcation were removed and sent to pathology.  Pathology revealed an intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct with focal high grade dysplasia in the intraductal tissue, proximal duct; no 
 invasive carcinoma identified.  4 lymph nodes were negative.      Pt did well until April 2016, when he developed recurrent abdominal pain, for which a repeat CT AP was obtained locally and showed a dilated remnant distal bile duct within the pancreatic head.  ERCP/EUS on May 1716 (at *****) showed 1.5cm mass in the remnant distal bile duct with high grade dysplasia on biopsy (notably, the pancreas appeared normal).  He was scheduled to have ***** in June 2016, but declined surgery in favor of herbal/alternative therapies.    He was lost to follow up until November 2019 when he presented with abdominal pain and a CT A/P on 12/14/19 showed an enlarging pancreatic head mass (compared to April 2016) though the official report comments on a normal pancreas.  An ERCP/EUS performed locally on 12/27/19 showed an ampullary mass--brushings of the bile duct showed non small cell carcinoma while a biopsy of the ampulla of ***** showed invasive adenocarcinoma.    After consultation with Dr. *****, plan was made for a ***** resection on 01/18/20.  However, intraoperatively he was found to have a pancreatic head mass with tumor involvement of the proper hepatic artery and portal vein. After consultation with Dr. ***** in the OR, the mass was felt to be unresectable, and the surgery was aborted--rather a ***** end-side hepatojejunostomy was performed.  Pathology from biopsy of the pancreas confirmed invasive adenocarcinoma.  There was also invasive adenocarcinoma in the bile duct excision.     He established care with UCSF GI Med Onc on 03/02/20.   03/07/20: Pancreatic Tumor *****: Reviewed scans, pathology.  See 03/02/20 initial consult note for full TB discussion.

Report dictated by: ***** ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** ***** *****, MD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging    Relevant New Pathology:  None new    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 62 y.o. male with  metastatic pancreaticobiliary cancer with radiographic evidence of liver lesions with history as above: initially s/p bile duct resection of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the CBD April 2015, remnant mass visualized on ERCP May 2016, s/p biopsy c/w high grade dysplasia.  Pt deferred definitive surgery, until presentation November 2019 with an ampullary mass visualized on ERCP/EUS with ampullary biopsy c/w invasive adenocarcinoma.  An attempted ***** was aborted on 01/18/20 given intraoperative findings of a pancreatic head mass with MPV and celiac axis involvement.    Presented at 03/02/20 ***** and consensus was for systemic therapy, potentially with *****/cis/abraxane given lack of ***** as to whether biliary, ampullary or pancreatic in origin.  We discussed, at length, the risks and benefits of proceeding with a three drug regimen that could target the three potential dx, vs, a two drug regimen that may trt one vs another better.  The 
 imaging characteristics of his tumor, and recent biopsy raise our suspicion for *****.  Pt is also inclined to treat as *****--as such he made an informed decision to proceed with gemcitabine and abraxane rather than the three drug regimen.     Initially started C1D1 (planned D1,8,15 of 28d cycle) *****/abraxane on 03/23/20.  This was, however poorly tolerated and c/b neutropenia requiring delay per pt preference.  He has also expressed strong preference to receive D1,15 trt rather than  d1,8,15, for better tolerability.  I discussed that trials demonstrating that the efficacy of d1,15 dosing is comparable to standard dose were only in the metastatic setting.  However, he prefers to preserve his ***** so he proceeded with D1 and ***** dosing.     Scans August 2020 s/p 6 months of *****/abraxane demonstrated trt response with decrease in the size of his pancreatic mass. He received consolidative chemoradiation from *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****. Unfortunately, rise in bilirubin prompted early scans 11/12/20 which showed the interval development of liver metastatic disease.     C1D1 ***** =11/29/20. C/b ***** rx with C1.  01/21/21 scans s/p C4 show improvement in liver mets    03/27/21 Scans s/p C9 showed continued improvement in hepatic metastases. Oxaliplatin was discontinued with C10 due to worsening neuropathy.  He completed ***** 5FU, and switched to capecitabine on 05/03/21.     Unfortunately restaging scans demonstrate new liver lesions, growth of prior lesions, and stable pancreatic primary.

155,Female,Asian,1957-01-29,"This is an independent visit    PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Ms. ***** is a 61 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her diagnosis of pancreas adenocarcinoma metastatic to liver currently participating in *****#***** Nivolumab/Abraxane/Gemcitabine ***** clinical trial.     ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:   She initially presented in November 2017 with what was thought to be gallstone pancreatitis. She underwent a cholecystectomy. Following this, she had recurrent pancreatitis and obstructive jaundice requiring a stent. Despite repeated imaging with ultrasound, no pancreatic abnormalities were identified.     On 02/25/2018 ***** ***** revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas. She underwent a core and fine-needle aspirate of the mass and this showed adenocarcinoma. She was apparently thought to be a candidate for resection. Prior to resection, CT/PET was done on 02/28/18. The CT suggested a possible cyst in the left lobe of the liver and a follow up PET suggested this was PET avid. She was told she had metastatic disease and has been scheduled for treatment with gemcitabine and Abraxane.    03/21/18: Patient had initial consultation with Dr. *****. We were hopeful that the PET was a false positive. An MRI to further evaluate the liver was recommended.     03/24/18: MRI showed multiple liver lesions, with rapid progression compared with 02/28/2018.    03/29/18: Signed informed consent for the ***** trial *****#*****     04/07/18: C1D1 *****#***** Nivolumab/Abraxane/Gemcitabine  04/13/18: ***** Abraxane/Gemcitabine  04/21/18: ***** Nivolumab/Abraxane/Gemcitabine  05/04/18: ***** Nivolumab/Abraxane/Gemcitabine  05/11/18: *****   06/01/18: ***** nivolumab/abraxane 125mg/m2/gemcitabine 1000mg/m2  06/08/18: *****  06/15/18: *****  06/29/18: C4D1  07/06/18: *****  07/13/18: *****  07/20/18: CT CAP reveals continued regression of metastatic disease  07/27/18: *****     INTERVAL HISTORY:   Presents

156,Female,White,1944-11-17,"Ms. ***** is a 71 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her resected node-positive pancreatic cancer, s/p pylorus-preserving ***** procedure on 04/27/2016. Her postoperative course was complicated by E. coli bacteremia, intra-abdominal abscess (Clostridium perfringens) requiring IR drainage and IV antibiotics; ileus requiring a temporary period of TPN; and occasional PRBC transfusions for drifting hematocrit with no evidence of active bleeding postoperatively.     She did ultimately recover from these complications and was well enough to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine beginning 06/14/2016, on an intended three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule. However, treatment had to be held after her first dose 2o to progressive transaminitis and alk phos elevation (with normal total bilirubin) and then an E. coli bacteremia, ***** hospital admission at *****. Abdominal U/S and CT scan showed only stable mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation without evidence of abscess, and clinically she continued to appear very well overall. She was covered with IV ertapenem --> switched to ceftriaxone, which she continued for 2-week course at home (per ID recommendations), completing it in mid-June, with repeat blood cultures thereafter showing no growth.     She ultimately re-started chemotherapy on 07/19/2016 (representing cycle #2), and received her full treatment cycle on a three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule w/o difficulty. Then, beginning cycle #3, based on recently presented *****-4 data demonstrating a benefit from the combination of gemcitabine plus ***** in this adjuvant setting, we added capecitabine to her regimen at a dose of 1500 mg QAM/1000 mg QPM on days January 20 of a 28-day cycle. However, a week after starting she developed fevers, diarrhea, stomatitis, N/V, fatigue, and abdominal pain for which 
 the capecitabine was held following a total of 6 days. As there was some concern of a melanotic component to her diarrhea, she was ultimately hospitalized at ***** ***** on 09/02/2016. EGD showed anastomotic ulcers for which she was started on a PPI. Stool studies were negative for infection, including C diff.     She was again readmitted to ***** ***** x 4 days from 9.16 - 09/18/2016 with high fevers 2o to an enterococcal bacteremia from a UTI, rx'ed with a course of PO antibiotics (amoxicillin), which she remains on to the present time. Due to these recurrent infectious complications, I referred her to ***** for consultation, but we agreed that there was no clear indication for suppressive antibiotics.    She has since resumed chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine, and has now completed 3 more cycles of monotherapy on a three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule, to bring her to a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy altogether. Her last dose ***** 12/20/2016.    Interval history/review of systems  Doing well overall, with an uneventful holidays. She continues to use ***** as she notes occasional oily stools. Appetite is excellent. She has had no recent fevers or intercurrent infectious complications. She denies any abdominal pain. She remains in good spirits overall, w/o evidence of depression or psychosis. The remainder of a full review of systems is negative.

Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 71 y.o. female s/p ***** resection of a node-positive pancreatic cancer, recently completing adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine (could not tolerate the combination of gemcitabine/capecitabine), with multiple and varying infectious complications along the way, not routinely in the context of neutropenia and with no consistently reliable source each time. Her last few cycles were more uneventful after she was simplified back to single-agent gemcitabine.    Recent surveillance imaging studies are reassuring for the absence of early disease recurrence. We will continue a plan for continued careful monitoring with repeat CT scans and labs again in an additional 3-4 months' time, recognizing her very high risk of relapse. We will keep her Mediport in place until her next visit and then plan to remove it at that time if she remains free of disease, arranging for monthly port flushes in the interim. Ms. ***** understands and is in agreement with this plan.     I spent a total of 25 minutes face-to-face with the patient, of which greater than 50% was spent in counseling regarding her cancer diagnosis.

END OF IMPRESSION:       ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   In summary, Mr. ***** is a 65 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.      Regarding his abdominal heaviness, while his symptoms are subtle, they are new for him.  We will contact to Dr. ***** to discuss his threshold for endoscopy in *****. *****.  Certainly if his symptoms worsen then that is something to pursue, but it may be reasonable to investigate as it stands right now, given he just stopped his prilosec post procedure.  If endoscopy is planned, we will contact him to arrange for one.       We reviewed his scans, which appear stable.  He did have some questions about the gastrohepatic lymphadenopathy noted on the scan, which appear to be a stable 1 cm node over several images.  We discussed that this could represent malignancy in a node, but could also be reactive in nature, and at this point its stability and size is somewhat reassuring, and that it should simply be followed moving forward.       As for other treatment options, he is well-versed regarding chemotherapeutic options, everolimus, sunitinib and clinical trial options.  Given his stable disease currently and lack of 
 symptoms related to malignancy, as well as his desire to remain active, we will simply plan on repeat imaging in about 4 months from his last scan, with follow up thereafter.      Thank you for involving me in the care of this very kind patient.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.

158,Female,White,1955-02-09,"Subjective:    This is a very pleasant 66-year-old woman who we first saw in early May 2012.  At that time, she was status post pylorus sparing ***** done on 05/04/2012.  Pathology showed a 2.5 cm well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a positive retroperitoneal margin in 8 of 12 lymph nodes were also positive.  She was started on adjuvant treatment with fixed dose rate gemcitabine plus capecitabine.  She has completed six 28 day cycles.    She does have known adnexal cystic lesions and is being followed by her gynecologist.  A repeat pelvic ultrasound done in 2918 showed no change. She saw Dr. ***** regarding this. His impression is that this is benign and can also be followed with surveillance.     She also has evidence for aortic stenosis on ***** ***** scan. She has been evaluated for this and there is no current indication for intervention.    In March 2014, she developed severe abdominal pain and was admitted to the hospital for pancreatitis. Attempts at enteroscopy were unsuccessful and her symptoms resolved. In February of this year she also had another episode of acute pancreatitis. This resolved without sequelae. A followup EUS was done on 05/10/2015. This was unremarkable and FNA revealed acute pancreatitis.    She developed a R frozen shoulder and had cortisone injections about 1 year ago. She also had a similar problem in the left shoulder and was treated with physical therapy and repeated cortisone injections    She's been seeing an endocrinologist because of fluctuating calcium and potassium levels. She was found to be hyperthyroid and she is now being treated with methimazole.    Her husband died at the end of December 2016. This has been very difficult for her but she is coping better now.     In November 2017, she developed an increase in a nodular consolidation in her right lung. This was PET avid. She was referred for a VATS wedge resection and this revealed a mucinous 
 adenocarcinoma consistent with a pancreas primary. There was some consideration of radiating other small nodules but in retrospect, these had been unchanged for some time and it was decided to follow her with CT surveillance.    In February 2022, she had a workup and was found to have esophageal reflux. This is being treated with a PPI.    She continues on surveillance. Her energy level is good. She feels healthy. She denies pain. She has a good appetite. Her weight is stable. She is having regular bowel movements.    She noted that she had been evaluated on 2 occasions for atherosclerotic disease. She was informed that since she was asymptomatic, this could just be followed.

 in conjunction with formal radiology report.  I appreciate findings demonstrating post-op changes, and only non-specific pulmonary findings including 1 cm RUL nodule.    Formal report is as follows:   CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST 02/05/2016   FINDINGS:    Visualized lung bases: For chest findings, please see the separately dictated report from the CT of the chest of the same date.    Liver: Unremarkable    Gallbladder: Surgically absent, with trace expected left-sided pneumobilia     Spleen: Unremarkable    Pancreas: Status post ***** with partial pancreatectomy. Nonspecific soft tissue prominence and mild fat stranding along the adjacent common hepatic artery is unchanged since 08/17/2015.     Adrenal Glands: Unremarkable    Kidneys: Unchanged 1.7 cm simple appearing left renal cyst. Additional subcentimeter hypodensities of the left kidney are too small to characterize but unchanged from prior and likely benign in etiology.    Vasculature: Unremarkable    GI Tract: Status post ***** with partial gastrectomy, gastrojejunostomy, and hepaticojejunostomy. Large stool burden throughout the colon, with ***** of distal small bowel loops suggestive of slowed transit/ileus.    Pelvis: Status post TURP.    Lymphadenopathy: Scattered small portacaval lymph nodes are unchanged from prior    Ascites: Absent    Bones: No suspicious lesions    IMPRESSION:     1. Ill-defined soft tissue along the common hepatic artery is unchanged since first postoperative CT scan on 08/17/2015 and therefore is favored to represent postsurgical scarring, however continued attention on follow-up imaging is recommended. Otherwise no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease.    2. Large stool burden throughout the colon with ***** of distal small bowel loops, suggestive of constipation.      CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST   AIRWAYS/LUNGS/PLEURA:  There is underlying diffuse patchy groundglass opacity, increased from 
 the prior exam. Reticulation and interlobular septal thickening in the lower lobes is more prominent. There is increased subpleural reticulation and groundglass opacity in the lower lobes. There is a new 1 cm nodular focus of consolidation in the right upper lobe (series 2, image 124) abutting the fissure.    HEART/MEDIASTINUM/VESSELS:   No thoracic lymphadenopathy. Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion. Normal caliber thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery.    VISIBLE ABDOMEN:  Please see separate abdomen/pelvis CT report of the same date.    BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  No suspicious bone or soft tissue lesions.    IMPRESSION:     1. Increased patchy bilateral groundglass opacities and increased intralobular septal thickening, subpleural and interstitial reticulation in the lung bases. In the absence of infectious symptoms, this is favored to represent sequelae of drug reaction.     2. New 1 cm right upper lobe nodule/nodular focus of consolidation which is favored to be part of the above described process. A solitary metastasis is possible but less likely and continued follow-up can be performed to ensure stability/resolution. No other evidence of metastatic disease in the chest.    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 73 y.o. male s/p ***** resection of a Stage II B (pT3N1) pancreatic adenocarcinoma, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel per the international randomized phase III ***** trial. He has now completed 6 of a planned 6 cycles of treatment, dose reduced x 2 levels due to asymptomatic neutropenia. He developed some mild treatment-related AEs (peripheral sensory neuropathy, fatigue -- both grade 1) that I reassured him should gradually improve off treatment.     Recent CT scans are likewise reassuring for the absence of disease recurrence, including the non-specific pulmonary findings that I explained to him are 
 likely c/w a mild drug-related pneumonitis; and at this point we will follow a plan for careful surveillance including regular CT scans initially at approx 3 month intervals per protocol, with regular f/u with me at these same time points for clinical and laboratory evaluation. He understands and is in agreement with the plan.    I spent a total of 25 minutes face-to-face with the patient, of which greater than 50% was spent in counseling regarding his cancer diagnosis.

162,Female,White,1949-02-14,"Family conference:    This is a very pleasant 65-year-old woman originally from ***** who is a good English *****. On March 17, she underwent a distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and portal vein reconstruction. Surgical pathology revealed an undifferentiated carcinoma with negative margins and associated evidence of chronic pancreatitis. There was no lymph node involvement. Her postoperative course was complicated by an intra-abdominal fluid collection and SMV thrombosis. A drain needed to be placed and she was started on anticoagulation. She also had a duodenal ileus.    When we initially saw her we were concerned about a lesion in her liver and wanted to repeat her scan. She also had just stopped TPN and was still quite weak from her surgery. This showed rapidly progressing liver metastases. At that point, we started gemcitabine and Abraxane. The day before she started treatment, she experienced symptoms of a stroke which she did not report. This was observed by caregivers and she underwent an MR which confirmed the stroke. She was briefly admitted to ***** for CT angiogram. There is no evidence of acute ischemic injury in no evidence of hemorrhage. She also had a TTE which was remarkable for some impaired left ventricular function. She feels that she's had good neurologic recovery.    She has now completed two full cycles of therapy.    She continues to have some nausea that is controlled with Zofran. She has a good appetite but has lost 3 kg. She notes that she is constipated and is using Dulcolax tablets and senna. She notices a little numbness in her toes on the right foot and she has some shuffling when she walks. She has some chronic edema with the left greater than the right. She feels that her chronic back pain is not as well controlled as it should be on fentanyl 12 mcg and Norco augmented by Neurontin.

164,Male,White,1948-07-22," UCSF Cancer Center GI Medical Oncology Program  ***** ***** *****, ***** *****  ***** ***** ***** *****-*****  Phone: *****-*****-***** | Fax: *****-*****-*****     Follow-up ***** *****  ***** : ***** *****, MD, *****        01/20/2017    ***** had the pleasure of seeing ***** ***** ***** for follow up of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma at our GI Medical Oncology practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.    Patient Identification and Oncology History  ***** ***** is a 68 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology practice at ***** ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.     Patient initially presented with epigastric discomfort and bloating which started in August 2016. His symptoms were initially managed with Pepcid and Mylanta which did not relieve his symptoms. He was referred to ***** and saw Dr. ***** who recommended EGD if no concerning findings were noted on the CT scan. A CT abdomen was obtained on 11/07/16 which showed a 6.6 cm ill-defined pancreatic mass with encasement of the celiac artery and of the splenic artery. The tumor abuts, and likely encases the superior mesenteric artery. The portal vein is encased and there is occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein from tumor encasement. The splenic vein is occluded.     Subcentimeter hypodense lesions were noted in the liver but were nonspecific. Of note, an intramedullary sclerotic lesion with preservation of cortex in the right seventh rib likely benign in etiology.    An EUS was performed on 11/12/16 which revealed a 50.7 X 33.5mm mass in the body of the pancreas along with a single 11.0X 6.1mm malignant appearing lymph node adjacent to the celiac axis.Subcentimeter peripancreatic lymph nodes were also seen. The biliary system was non-dilated and had no endosonographic abnormalities. There were no endosonographic abnormalities in the visualized portion of the liver. 
 Cytopathology from the FNA of the mass revealed adenocarcinoma.    He was seen by Dr. ***** on 11/18/16 and ***** chemotherapy was recommended for the locally advanced/potentially resectable disease. His case will also be presented at the tumor board meeting.     Of note, patient has a history of distal sensory small fiber neuropathy which was previously evaluated by Dr. ***** ***** at ***** on 11/05/10. He has been taking gabapentin 300 mg orally twice daily which was recently increased to 600 mg twice daily. He is also taking alpha lipoic acid and borage oil 500 mg/d. The neuropathy initially started in the toes and over the years, it has involved the bottom of the feet R>L. He is still able to play golf without any problems, no issues with gait and no falls. He doesn't feel that he has difficulty with balance while ambulating. No neuropathy involving the fingers.     11/28/16: PET/MRI revealed multiple liver lesions (March 20) measuring subcentimeter with hypermetabolic activity were noted suggesting metastatic disease.    11/29/16: Cycle 1 of *****.    12/06/16: ***** requested    12/23/16: EUS performed for tissue acquisition for the UCSF 500 testing.    12/24/16: PET/MRI (for the study) - The primary and liver mets are smaller and less FDG avid on the PET (largest liver met previously was 1.2cm, and now is 7mm). The primary tumor is also much less conspicuous on the new scan.     Interim History  Since his last visit with me, he has been doing well overall. He has been eating better and gaining weight. He did not like the way he felt on pancreatic enzymes - he said that he couldn't focus as well and felt foggy. When he stopped using them, he felt much better. He has been playing golf.  His neuropathy is stable in his feet and he denies any issues with gait. The neuropathy in his fingers are transient and mild. No issues with ***** his *****. He had loose BM for 1 day and 2 tabs of imodium helped. He 
 otherwise has regular BM. He takes 1/2 tab of Ambien when he wakes up in the middle of the night and this has helped (he did this twice over the past 2 weeks). He had his restaging scans this morning.    Review of Systems  General: no recent fevers or chills, good appetite, easy fatigability but able to play golf, weight gain  Skin: no rashes, lesions or jaundice  Eyes: no vision changes  HENT: no change in hearing, no nasal discharge or sinus tenderness. No mouth sores or sore throat  Respiratory: no cough or shortness of breath  Cardiovascular: no chest pain, or palpitations, no leg swelling  GI: mild nausea, no vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, no melena or BRBPR  GU: no dysuria, no hematuria  Heme: no recent bleeding or bruising  Endocrine:  normal hair texture, no change in cold or heat intolerance  Musculoskeletal: no joint or back pain  Neurologic: no headaches, dizziness, falls. Positive for numbness or tingling in his feet stable (not affecting activity level); mild neuropathy in the fingertips.

VISIBLE ABDOMEN:  Please see dedicated Abdomen and Pelvis CT report.    IMPRESSION:   Unchanged exam. No new intrathoracic metastatic disease.    ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** ***** is a 68 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology  practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for a follow-up visit of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patient received cycle 1 of ***** on 11/29/16 and has been tolerating it well with minimal nausea (not requiring any antiemetics).    He participated in the PET/MRI study and scans after cycle 2 revealed suggestion of treatment response. His most recent restaging CT scans on 01/20/17 after 4 cycles showed treatment response with decrease in the size of pancreatic mass with decreased mass effect on the portal splenic confluence and proximal SMV. The hepatic lesions were noted to be stable. I reviewed the results of the CT scan with the patient. His CA 19-9 level has been declining since initiation of the chemotherapy.    His labs and performance status are appropriate to proceed with cycle 5 of ***** tomorrow.   The dosing of ***** is as follows:   -5FU 2400mg/m2 over 48 hours,   -oxaliplatin 65 mg/m2 (20 % dose reduction for baseline neuropathy in his feet),   -irinotecan 180 mg/m2 on day 1   (administered every 14 days)    -As there is a high incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia with this regimen, he is receiving prophylaxis with growth factor support (*****) on day 3 of each cycle.   -He also receives IV fluids and dexamethasone on day 3.     -If the patient agrees to proceed with standard chemotherapy, we will monitor treatment response with monthly CA 19-9 levels and restaging CT scans every 2 months (next scan tentatively scheduled for March).       #Supportive care: He is on Ambien for 
 insomnia and is no longer on pancreatic enzymes. Patient has a supply of antiemetics and EMLA. I recommended that he maintain his weight with small frequent meals. I also recommended that he stay active as chemotherapy associated fatigue is well-managed with activity. Due to the ***** ***** ancestry, we previously recommended genetic counseling. He saw them in consultation and the results did not reveal any mutations that would suggest a hereditary component to his diagnosis.    #Goals of care: Palliative.    #Follow-up: Patient will return to our clinic in 2 weeks. As always, we reminded the patient to call us with any questions or concerns in the meantime.    I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction. I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 40 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, medication risks, lifestyle modification and scan results.        ***** *****, MD, MS  Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine  Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology   UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center  01/20/2017

165,Male,White,1949-07-14,"Mr. ***** is a 63 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his metastatic pancreatic cancer, BRCA2-associated, currently receiving salvage chemotherapy with *****. He had previously been enrolled in our phase I clinical trial evaluating the combination of ***** plus the oral hedgehog inhibitor IPI-926; we ultimately had to take him off treatment after 6 cycles (and two dose reductions in the *****), despite evidence of good disease control, due to significant cumulative fatigue. He subsequently resumed therapy consisting of reduced-dose biweekly ***** in December 2011, and completed 12 cycles in total with excellent disease control. Following a chemotherapy holiday since June 2012, he demonstrated radiographic evidence of further disease progression (locoregional recurrence in the pancreatic tail, plus nodal and mesenteric implants), on which basis we resumed him on ***** in November. He received 6 cycles, well-tolerated overall; however, CT scan on 02/20/2013 demonstrated modest disease progression, including a new right hepatic 1.1 cm lesion and increased soft tissue density around the celiac artery and enlargement of retroperitoneal lymph nodes. On this basis, we elected to switch him to the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel on an every-other-week dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 in 28-day cycles). He has now completed 3 full cycles of treatment.     On present review of systems, the patient notes that he has been tolerating current treatment very well, with mild fatigue, flu-like symptoms and skeletal pains that last 3-4 days following each chemotherapy infusion. He reports a good appetite with stable to increasing weight. He is less active than previously although thinks his energy level remains fairly good. He denies any diarrhea. He has some mild chronic L-sided abdominal discomfort. He does have treatment-related 
 peripheral sensory neuropathy primarily involving the feet, slightly worse than before but not debilitating. He does continue to use ***** heparin for a previously diagnosed VTE, with no bleeding complications. He has partial alopecia. He does have some ongoing anxiety with associated heart racing.    The remainder of the patient's review of systems was negative.    Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.   Medication Sig    calcium carbonate 220 mg capsule Take 250 mg by mouth 2 (two) times daily with meals.      cholecalciferol, vitamin D3, 1000 UNITS TAB Take 1,000 Units by mouth Twice a day.      enoxaparin (LOVENOX) 100 mg/mL SYRINGE Sig: lovenox 100mg syringe, inject SQ daily    LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg tablet Take 1 tablet (1 mg total) by mouth every 6 (six) hours as needed (nausea).    magnesium 30 mg tablet Take 30 mg by mouth 2 (two) times daily.      MELATONIN, *****, MISC by Misc.(Non-Drug; Combo Route) route.      multivitamin tablet Take 1 tablet by mouth Daily.      vitamin B complex no.12-niacin 50 mg/15 mL LIQ Take by mouth.

Small mesenteric nodes are similar to prior. Ascites: Absent Bones: 
 No suspicious lesions. Unchanged anterior wedge deformity of L1.       IMPRESSION:  Mixed response with decrease in size of pancreatic tail mass, unchanged retroperitoneal lymph nodes and increased size of hepatic metastasis.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 63 y.o. male with longstanding metastatic *****, *****-related, currently receiving salvage chemotherapy with  the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel. Recent CT scans show a mixed response to treatment. He does not overexpress *****-9 so this is not a useful gauge of his tumor burden/response. On balance, though, he seems to be deriving clinical benefit from current therapy and is tolerating it quite well overall, and thus we will continue along the same lines for a couple of additional cycles followed by short-term reimaging in early July. Thereafter, we will anticipate on a treatment holiday for at least a month as long as his disease remains relatively stable.    The patient understands and is in agreement with the plan. Follow-up will be scheduled with me again in 4 weeks' time.

The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all outside records.    History of Present Illness     This pleasant gentleman initially presented with painless jaundice after several months of weight loss (approximately 100 lbs over the past 6 weeks). An abdominal ultrasound was obtained on 01/15/21 which showed intrahepatic biliary dilatation and mild dilatation of the pancreatic duct along with 3.4cm partially exophytic pancreatic head mass. On 01/16/21, CT abdomen was obtained which showed 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm hypodense mass pancreatic head concerning for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Resultant moderate intrahepatic and extrahepatic ductal dilatation with more normal caliber distal CBD near the ampulla of *****. Mild dilatation pain pancreatic duct in the pancreatic head up to 4 mm. Nonocclusive thrombus is observed within the superior mesenteric vein as it extends cephalad into the confluence with SMV. Main portal vein, intrahepatic portal branches, celiac axis, SMA remain patent. Borderline size peripancreatic lymph nodes measuring 9 mm.  ?  On January 18, ERCP/EUS was performed and revealed a pancreatic head mass measuring ***** leading to distal biliary stricture and upstream pancreatic and biliary ductal dilatation. During the procedure, a biliary stent was placed. FNA from the biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.  ?  PET/CT obtained on 01/30/21 did not reveal distant metastatic disease. Surgical oncology consultation was on February 05 with Dr. ***** when neoadjuvant chemotherapy was recommended. He was evaluated by Dr. ***** 02/05/21 when recommendation for low 
 dose gemcitabine + *****-paclitaxel was made.    CT pancreas protocol was obtained today and showed ill-defined pancreatic head mass with celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery being clear of tumor involvement. No definite involvement of the superior mesenteric vein. Slight interval decrease in size of superior mesenteric vein nonocclusive thrombus compared to prior scan. Small portion of this thrombus at its inferior aspect is nearly occlusive. Mildly enlarged peripancreatic lymph nodes, nonspecific and unchanged compared to prior examination. No evidence for distant metastatic disease.  He was seen by Dr. ***** today and the recommendation was made for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.     He is on a wheelchair today- he states that he is using wheelchair to reduce the risk of falls as he feels unstable. He has been experiencing neuropathy for several years but has not been evaluated for a potential underlying etiology. Gabapentin helps with the neuropathy. He states that he has mostly been less active due to exacerbation of gout and neuropathy lately. The last time he was active was in November - he used to play with his grandchildren. He had constipation and took senna and colace for a week before he was able to have a BM. He had decline in his appetite which is slightly improving s/p bilary stent placement.        The patient's present review of systems was reviewed and notable for the following:    Constitutional: no fevers, chills, night sweats; positive for weight loss  *****: no visual disturbances, including blurry vision or diplopia  ENT: no hearing disturbances, no taste changes  Respiratory: no shortness of breath or cough.

Pathology  01/17/21 FNA  PANCREAS, HEAD, ENDOSCOPIC ULTRASOUND-GUIDED FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY: ADENOCARCINOMA               Assessment and Plan       In summary, ***** ***** ***** is a 75 y.o. male with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a tumor that is not involving the celiac axis or SMA. However, Dr. ***** believes that the resection may possibly require a segmental vein resection. As the patient has a thrombus in the vein, there may be potential complications related to that. For this reason, *****. ***** recommends *****/neoadjuvant chemotherapy to increase the chance of an ***** resection.  ?  During today's visit, we reviewed the potential systemic treatment options including gemcitabine monotherapy, 
 gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel and *****. I reviewed that the highest chance of cure for pancreatic cancer is with surgery. So, our treatment goal is to increase the chance of him going to surgery for a successful resection by providing ***** chemotherapy. Due to his marginal performance status and neuropathy, ***** would be too toxic and may cause more harm than benefit in his treatment course. In addition, due to his declining activity level, my recommendation for systemic therapy is to proceed with gemcitabine monotherapy to determine if he will tolerate this. I would then recommend adding *****-paclitaxel with subsequent doses if he is able to tolerate gemcitabine monotherapy.     I informed him of the potential side effects of the regimen which may include : fatigue, nausea, vomiting, alopecia, diarrhea and neuropathy, myelosuppression, increased risk of infections, bleeding and requirement for blood transfusions (with addition of *****-paclitaxel).      I recommend monitoring treatment response with monthly CA 19-9 levels and restaging CT scans with contrast every 2 months (CT abdomen to be with pancreatic protocol). I would recommend obtaining baseline labs including CA 19-9 on the first cycle of chemotherapy. I reviewed that CT pancreatic protocol can be reviewed at every 2 months to consider when surgery may potentially be possible. I also encouraged him to increase his activity level as much as possible and decrease the risk of further deconditioning so that he can be stronger for potential surgery.    He has met with our genetic counselors and the genetic testing is currently pending. They are quite interested in learning about complementary medicine and I will place a referral to our ***** Integrative Medicine Center for their evaluation and recommendations.      I recommend palliative care consultation locally so that his symptoms can be addressed along with his antineoplastic 
 treatment.      # Obstructive jaundice: now s/p ERCP and plastic biliary stent placement. He does not appear jaundiced today and his lab trends show that his bilirubin is decreasing. As the biliary stent was plastic, he will be scheduled for a stent exchange (he is already scheduled). At that time, a metal stent can be placed (if possible lower).    #DMII: he was asked to start Metformin but he still has not started. I recommended that he start it if this was recommended.    # Hypothyroidism: he was placed on levothyroxine but has not started taking this. I reviewed that some of his fatigue and constipation may be due to hypothyroidism. So, I recommended that he start using the levothyroxine.    # SMV thrombus - on Eliquis; no bleeding complications.          #  Pain  Pain assessment for this encounter  Pain Score/Location    02/09/21 1339   *****: 0  Comment: VST FROM SAME DAY APPT      Pain management plan outlined below as of 02/09/21   No changes recommended    #  Cancer stage at diagnosis  Cancer Staging  Pancreatic cancer (CMS code)  Staging form: Exocrine Pancreas, AJCC 8th Edition  - Clinical: Stage IIB (*****, *****, *****) - Signed by ***** *****, MD on 02/11/2021    Below for billing only     I reviewed external records from 3+ providers outside my specialty or healthcare organization as summarized in the note.    I spent a total of 90 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    I am happy to follow-up with the patient at any point in the future. I will provide a copy of this consultation letter to Dr. ***** and would be 
 happy to collaborate on the care of Mr. ***** with him.     ***** *****, MD, MS  Associate Clinical Professor in ***** *****   UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center         Addendum:  Patient notified that he would like to start chemotherapy here at *****.

167,Male,White,1953-03-19,"Mr. ***** is a 69 y.o. male whom I am seeing at our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in follow up for his resected ampullary cancer.     History of Present Illness, reviewed:  This pleasant gentleman's oncologic history is as follows:     March 2021: Developed diarrhea and obstructive jaundice symptoms shortly after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery   04/20/2021: Presented to local ED and admitted with abdominal pain and jaundice. Total bilirubin 6.1 on admission.   Abdominal U/S and CT scan (04/20/2021) notable for moderate dilatation of the intra and extrahepatic biliary ducts, dilated CBD tapering at the pancreatic head; no discrete mass appreciated   ERCP (04/20/2021): Abnormal ampulla noted. Pancreatic duct was 2.8 mm in the body and 4.2 mm in the head. No obvious mass lesion. Bile ducts upstream were dilated, as well as the gallbladder. The common bile duct measured 15 mm. A distal narrowing with a 1 cm stricture was documented. Thickened duct with upstream dilatation. Underwent sphincterotomy, balloon sweep. Biliary stent placed. Duct brushings pathology noted as atypical, favored to represent reactive/degenerative change. Patient did develop some post-procedural pancreatitis.   05/02/2021: Consult with Dr. ***** ***** (UCSF Surg Onc); index of suspicion high of a ampullary carcinoma, recommended ***** procedure, which was performed on 05/16/2021 at ***** ***** Hospital. Final pathology:  -----------------  Tumor Site:  Intra-ampullary: Ampullary ductal   (pancreaticobiliary-type)   Histologic Type:  Adenocarcinoma, pancreaticobiliary type   Histologic Grade:  G2 Moderately differentiated (50% to 95% of tumor   composed of glands)   Tumor Size:  3.2 cm   Extent Of Tumor:  Invades into duodenal submucosa and muscularis   propria, extends more than 0.5 cm into pancreas and extends into   peripancreatic soft tissue   Margins: All margins negative for invasive 
 carcinoma and high-grade   dysplasia   Lymphovascular Invasion: Focal, present   Lymph Node Status     Number Examined:  23     Number Involved:  1   Pathologic Staging (pTNM):  *****   ------------------------  The patient's postop course was largely uncomplicated except for pain management, and he was able to be d/c'ed to home on 05/22/2021.    He initiated chemotherapy with ***** beginning on 07/21/2021, but after 2 cycles his regimen had to be simplified to ***** alone, with elimination of the irinotecan, due to an infusion-related irinotecan reaction (LE and shoulder pain, tongue swelling, visual changes) not responding to rescue atropine. He then required a 20% decrease in his oxaliplatin dose beginning cycle #4 due to progressive peripheral sensory neuropathy, and ultimately elimination of the oxaliplatin altogether beginning cycle #8. He then completed the remaining 4 cycles of chemotherapy (biweekly ***** 5FU/LV), for a total of 12 cycles, by the end of November 2021.    The patient's present review of systems was reviewed. This ***** he began developing some position-related periumbilical pain, along with bandlike pain across his mid-abdomen, accompanied by occasional nausea, starting around the same time as he was diagnosed with *****-19 infection.  While CT scans in mid-March did not show show any clear radiographic evidence of disease, he noted some palpable abdominal wall nodules. Repeat imaging (CT-PET) on 05/18/2022 confirmed new hypermetabolic abdominal wall lesions, along with an FDG-avid RP LN. One of these abdominal wall lesions was biopsied on 06/01/2022, the results which are still pending.    He initiated chemotherapy with the combination of gemcitabine plus cisplatin on 05/27/2022 on a planned two-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule.

IMPRESSION/PLAN  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 69 y.o. male with a ***** ampullary adenocarcinoma (pancreatobiliary subtype), s/p ***** pancreaticoduodenectomy on 05/16/2021, followed by receipt of 12 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with ***** --> simplified to dose-modified ***** and then ultimately biweekly ***** 5FU/LV. Treatment was completed at the end of November 2021.    He now shows evidence of metastatic recurrence involving the abdominal wall, possibly representing surgical track seeding, along with a RP LN, and has initiated chemotherapy with the combination of gemcitabine plus cisplatin. We did talk about the future possibilities of locoregional intervention (including surgical resection of these abdominal wall lesions, which would involve a major reconstruction; or RT as a less morbid but less definitive option), but I emphasized that the highest immediate priority ***** his chemotherapy and that we could consider these other modalities down the road (after at least a couple of months of chemotherapy) depending on his response to current systemic rx. We will plan on repeat imaging (CT-PET) for formal tumor assessment after completion of 2-3 cycles, but hopefully we will be able to appreciate some improvement in his palpable abdominal wall metastases sooner than that.    Additional points:  - Pain management: adequate with Tylenol only for now.  - Somatic profiling 
 (Foundation) results of his original surgical specimen reviewed, notable for MSS tumor with TMB of 0 muts/Mb; and mutations in ***** (*****, *****, NOTCH1, and *****, none of which are immediately *****.  - Given a personal history of melanoma and now ampullary cancer, he has undergone undergo genetic counseling with germline testing (Invitae) showing no hereditary pathogenic mutations, but a VUS in *****.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his and his family's satisfaction.        Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient has an active cancer that represents a life-threatening illness.    Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities.

169,Male,White,1947-06-10,"Mr. ***** is a 66 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his metastatic pancreatic cancer.     To review briefly, the patient was originally diagnosed back in March 2012 with borderline resectable disease and initiated chemotherapy with ***** on 04/20/2012. Shortly after completion of his first treatment cycle he developed obstructive jaundice, for which he was hospitalized in ***** and underwent MRCP and ERCP on 04/29/2012 with placement of an ***** stent.     His LFTs improved sufficiently to allow him to receive his 2nd cycle without irinotecan (*****) on 05/20/12. The patient then required a repeat ERCP on 06/03/12 secondary to persistent hyperbilirubinemia; biliary obstruction was noted in the distal bile duct and his stent was exchanged for two plastic stents. Thereafter, his laboratory parameters improved and he symptomatically felt much better, and was able to resume ***** at full doses for cycles #3 and 4. Starting with cycle #5, ***** was dose reduced by 20-25% for better tolerability. Following this fifth cycle, he was admitted to the ***** of the Valley Hospital on *****/*****-*****/*****/***** with fevers, diarrhea, and dehydration, for which he was treated with Levaquin and also underwent ERCP on 07/29/12 with stent exchange. Following recovery, he received one final cycle of ***** alone in August 2012.   He was subsequently taken to surgery here on 09/07/2012, where he was found to have a firm mass in the head of pancreas, closely adherent to but not invading the SMV and able to be separated. A successful ***** operation was performed, with final surgical pathology revealing a ***** tumor with direct invasion into multiple structures, negative margins, +perineural invasion, and 0/14 LNs positive. The patient's postoperative course was notable for a bout of C difficile colitis, but he was well enough to be discharged to home on 
 09/23/2012. He did not receive any further adjuvant treatment thereafter.     F/u CT scans in late April 2013 showed new evidence of metastatic disease involving the liver. On this basis, he re-started chemotherapy, this time consisting of the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel initially on a 3-week-on, 1-week-off schedule. This has required growth factor support after day 15 of each treatment cycle, a dose reduction early on of the *****-paclitaxel due to peripheral sensory neuropathy, and an eventual change to a dosing schedule of two weeks on/two weeks off. He has remained on treatment to the present time.    He has demonstrated a nice *****-9 biomarker decline on therapy, most recently measuring 80 on most recent measurement (down from a starting value in the 400s). Serial imaging has been performed here at *****; most recent CT scans from last week show essentially stable findings in his hepatic and nodal metastases (see below).    On present review of systems, the patient continues to do well overall and s staying active, although he did note slightly more difficulty with his most recent cycle of chemotherapy. He has some cumulative non-debilitating peripheral sensory neuropathy involving feet>hands. He has occasional mild epigastric discomfort, and a solitary episode of postprandial vomiting two weeks ago. BMs are frequent and regular. He has had no recent fevers, chills, or infectious complications. The remainder of the patient's review of systems was negative.

Few stable scattered subcentimeter mesenteric nodes.  Ascites: Absent  Bones:  No suspicious lesions   IMPRESSION:  Status post ***** procedure for pancreatic cancer with similar appearance of hepatic metastasis and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy compared to 01/02/2014.       Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 66 y.o. male with metastatic *****, continuing to show evidence of good disease control on his current salvage chemotherapy regimen consisting of the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, which he has been on now for the past year. He remains highly functional with modest cumulative toxicities from prolonged chemotherapy.    At this point, while indefinite treatment with gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel (or conceivably just gemcitabine alone) could be offered, I would be more in favor of a chemotherapy holiday for the next few months, which the patient and his wife are entirely in agreement with. He understands well that at some point again his disease will progress and 
 require consideration of further treatment. I will go ahead and order him for f/u CT scans again in 3 months' time, at which point he can also have repeat labs inc *****-9 checked.     At a point where he needs to resume therapy down the road, either ***** with gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel, or exploring experimental clinical trial options, would be appropriate to consider. Of note, we do still have open here at ***** a randomized phase II trial evaluating CRS-207 for chemotherapy refractory *****, which is an attenuated mesothelin-expressing Listeria vaccine. On this study, patients are randomized to either CRS-207 alone, CRS-207 in combination with *****, or standard single-agent chemotherapy [gemcitabine, capecitabine, 5-*****, irinotecan, or erlotinib]). He may represent a good candidate for this study if he is interested.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction. Overall, I am very pleased and impressed with how he is doing at this point.

170,Male,White,1944-12-18,"This is an independent service.  The available consultant for this service is ***** *****, MD.       PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Mr. ***** is a 74 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.     Patient was evaluated by Dr. ***** on 03/03/19 for history of pancreatitis in 2012 and 2017. An MRI was obtained in January 2019 which showed bulky head of the pancreas ***** enhancing mass lesion.The body and tail of the pancreas was ***** pancreatic duct dilation. There was no biliary ductal dilation seen. A small peripancreatic collection was also noted that was thought to be suspicious for a pseudocyst. Subsequently, EUS was performed on 03/12/19 and showed a 25.3 X 22.4mm round, hypoechoic, calcified and solid mass was identified in the head of the pancreas. The mass invaded into the main pancreatic duct causing pancreatic duct dilation and common bile duct. The mass abutted the superior mesenteric vein without clear invasion. ERCP was performed with distal malignant bile duct stricture and bare metal stenting after EUS-guided rendez-vous, as initial cannulation was challenging. Pathology from the FNA revealed adenocarcinoma.     03/03/19: CA 19-9 = 96    He presented to the ED on 03/18/2019 with abdominal pain associated with nausea & vomiting when a CT A/P noted a gastric outlet obstruction. An ERCP was performed on 03/22/19 which showed duodenal obstruction from tumor compression. A EUS guided gastrojejunostomy with a 15 mm ***** lumen ***** metal stent was placed. CT abdomen was obtained on 03/23/19 which showed interval increased size of rim enhancing debris collection in the right upper quadrant, which likely represents progression of sequela from previously described bowel perforation. New thrombus in ***** ***** ***** (series 601, image 73) with interval progression of SMV 
 occlusion compared to prior study.      On 03/24/19, he underwent CT-guided drain placement for abdominal abscess + Abx. CT A/P with PO and oral contrast on 03/29/2019 demonstrated no evidence of a leak and continued resolution of his intra-abdominal abscess. Given this improvement, his diet was then slowly advanced, first to a clear liquid diet and then to a full liquid diet which he tolerated without any nausea and without any change to the drain output concerning for a leak.     He was discharged on 04/02/19. On 04/21/19, the drain was removed.     Due to SMV involvement and ascites, he was not found to be a surgical candidate. During his last visit with Dr. ***** on 04/21/19, he noted the presence of ascites which raised the concern for malignant ascites. The CT abd also showed slight increase in moderate right and small left left bilateral pleural effusions. There was an unchanged 1 cm hypodense lesion within hepatic segment 2. No significant change in infiltrative ill-defined low-attenuation pancreatic head mass with upstream irregular pancreatic ductal dilatation. There were three developing fluid collections along the lesser and greater curvature of the gastric antrum near the gastrojejunal stent and pancreas. Collections measure 5.5 x 1.7 cm (series 3, image 58), 1.6 x 1.4 cm (series 3, image 58), and 2.1 x 1.4 cm (series 3, image 56). There was also increasing diffuse anasarca.     04/23/19: Initial clinic visit with Dr. *****  04/23/19: Doppler u/s BLE: positive DVT to both left and right proximal femoral veins, non-occlusive  04/24/19: Started on enoxaparin 1mg/kg BID  04/29/3019: Admitted to ***** Memorial Hospital with fevers/rigors and found to have bacteremia/CAP.  05/06/19: CA 19-9 = 1,011  05/13/2019: Paracentesis (removed 2500 ml)  05/14/19: C1D1 Gemcitabine single-agent. CA 19-9 = 347  05/20/19: ***** gemcitabine   05/27/19: ***** gemcitabine    INTERVAL HISTORY:   Patient presents for urgent 
 visit related to overall decline. Since ***** gemcitabine he has had a marked decline. He is spending most of the day in bed and gets out of bed at around 12pm or 1pm. He then manages to sit up on the couch for part of the day before returning to bed. Needs assistance with getting out of bed. Not eating very much due to altered taste sensation, poor appetite, and early satiety. Abdominal distension has increased and he is feeling more uncomfortable.     He denies any acute pain, fevers, chills, falls, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, emesis.     REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   14 point ROS completed and all other systems were reviewed and are negative.

He is now s/p ***** gemcitabine on 05/27/19. Has had increased overall decline in *****. We will plan to add *****-paclitaxel with cycle 2 if he *****.    Patient returns to see Dr. ***** on June 11 for consideration of ***** ***** +/- Abraxane. It is concerning to see how his PS has worsened since starting chemotherapy. I spent time with patient, his wife, *****, and son, *****, discussing the options of continuing with more chemo versus shifting our goals to palliative care. I also discussed the role of hospice and explained that we could start hospice services if it is decided that he should not proceed with more cancer treatment. Patient understood the options and will think this over and can discuss further with Dr. *****.     He will receive IV fluids today.     #Anemia: Improved   HGB today: 9.1     #bilateral ***** & ascites  - Now s/p paracentesis 05/13/19  - Ascites now increased.

171,Male,White,1943-07-26,"Subjective:     He presented in December 2014. CT scan, performed at ***** for abdominal and back pain, demonstrated a 3.2 x 2.2 mass in the body of the pancreas with partial encasement of the SMV, splenic vein, and splenic portal confluence.  Several borderline prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes were identified.  There were no focal hepatic or bony lesions, or other evidence of distant metastatic disease.  Tissue biopsy obtained during EUS confirmed adenocarcinoma.    The patient was consented to receive first-line therapy for his borderline resectable disease via the *****# ***** clinical trial protocol studying ***** (pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase) with chemotherapy.  After a ***** ***** *****-in period with ***** on Days 1 and 4, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 8 infusions of *****, *****-paclitaxel and gemcitabine were given on February 10 & *****/*****.  Day 15 infusions were held on 02/23/2015 for CTCAE grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.    Cycle 2, Day 1 infusions of all 3 study agents at full dose were given on 03/03/2015.  The patient self-administered Neupogen on Days 3 and 4, resulting in severe spine and rib pain, nausea and fatigue shortly after the 2nd injection.  He stayed in bed the remainder of the day and did not eat or drink.  He was seen in the ***** ***** on 03/07/2015 and received IV hydration, ondansetron and hydromorphone with improvement in symptoms.    Cycle 2, day 8 infusions were better tolerated. He did experience some esophageal spasm and also developed thrush which was treated with fluconazole. He had excessive bone pain with Neupogen but this was managed with Claritin. He's had recurrent cramping, grade 2, which has been managed with intermittent Decadron. On day 21 of cycle 2, he required IV fluids. He was noted to be confused but it was felt this might have been due to lorazepam. He had sharp increase in pain in his right upper quadrant tenderness resulted in the trip to the ED. 
 Eventually the pain resolved and because of the long wait in the ED he left *****. Chest x-ray done at that time was unremarkable.    His chest CT at one point suggested multiple new pulmonary nodules but he had evidence of good tumor control with a decreasing size of mass in the pancreas and a falling CA-19-9. He did see a pulmonologist who felt that these were inflammatory in nature and should be observed.    He had an episode of bursitis in his L elbow which is now resolved.     He  completed 4 cycles of therapy. On June 21, he underwent a distal pancreatectomy, en bloc splenectomy and en bloc resection of the portal vein. Pathology revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with 1 of 13 lymph nodes positive. Margins were negative.    Following surgery, he received his final 2 cycles of gemcitabine and Abraxane. After completing treatment, he experienced a DVT and he resumed Lovenox therapy. He has completed a 3 month course.    Eventually, he began to have some mild back pain. CT scan revealed a soft tissue mass around the celiac access and adenopathy. He underwent an EUS guided biopsy and this revealed adenocarcinoma.    We then elected to resume chemotherapy but switched to reduced dose *****. He did not tolerate this well. After 8 cycles, he had stable disease in the abdomen but progressing pulmonary metastases and we decided to give him a chemotherapy holiday. When we saw him in October 2016, he was having progressive disease. We elected to start gemcitabine and Abraxane. He has now had almost 4 cycles.    He is scheduled for day 15 cycle 4 today. He is coming in to discuss his overall management and he is very worried about his upcoming scan.    He is depressed but is now on Effexor. His energy level is decreased but he thinks this is a bit better on ginseng and he is going to restart his Ritalin. He does have some mild neuropathy and this ***** some with his fine motor skills but he is 
 comfortable about this. His pain is well controlled on fentanyl and methadone with hydromorphone for breakthrough. His appetite is fair. He does have occasional nausea and responds to Compazine. He is having regular bowel movements but alternates between constipation and diarrhea.    Recently, he had an episode of shortness of breath and dyspnea with exertion. He went to the ED and was found to have a PE. He has now started on Lovenox.

RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS: ***** ***** ***** ***** received 2 exposure event(s) (excluding scout) during this CT study. CTDIvol:  4.5 - 5.7 mGy. DLP: 181 mGy-cm. The dose indicators for CT are the volume Computed Tomography Dose Index and the Dose Length Product(DLP), and are measured in units of mGy and mGy-cm, respectively. These indicators are not patient dose, but values generated from the CT scanner acquisition factors. Individual patient doses calculated from these values will depend on patient size and can substantially underestimate or overestimate the actual dose.

The attending physician ***** the medical necessity of the chest CT obtained in this patient according to our ""pulmonary embolism"" protocol, and its processing. Chest CT and its processing (creation of maximal intensity projections on the CT scanner *****) were required in this patient because they: -provide accurate assessment of pulmonary arteries -can confirm or rule out the presence of central, segmental and/or subsegmental pulmonary embolism -helps differentiating pulmonary embolism form other mimicking entities such as adjacent veins or lymphadenopathy 
 FINDINGS: PULMONARY ARTERIES: Acute central filling defects in the right upper lobe apical segmental and more distal subsegmental pulmonary arteries. No other filling defects in the pulmonary arterial tree are seen although evaluation of the lower lobes is nondiagnostic given degree of respiratory motion. Main pulmonary artery is normal in caliber measuring 2.8 cm. LUNGS: Qualitative increase in degree of perilymphatic nodules and interlobular septal thickening in the upper lobes. Accurate comparison to the prior exam in the lower lungs is prevented by marked respiratory motion. PLEURA: Trace left pleural effusion, new. MEDIASTINUM: No intrathoracic lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria. Unchanged appearance of rim calcified thyroid nodules. HEART/***** *****: Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion.  Normal caliber thoracic aorta and main pulmonary artery. Right chest port terminates in the right atrium. BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious lesions.

173,Female,White,1950-11-16,"REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  Second opinion    REFERRING PHYSICIAN:  ***** *****    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:    This is a very pleasant 68-year-old woman, a known BRCA2 carrier, with a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. She presented in March 2018 with a mass in the uncinate process and CT scan had evidence of peritoneal involvement with hepatic capsular implants and a peritoneal nodule. She was started on combination therapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin plus rucaparib. She had an excellent radiographic response with resolution of the peritoneal disease and decrease in the size of the pancreatic mass. In October 2019, chemotherapy was discontinued and she continues on rucaparib.    She has a prior history of ovarian cancer presenting with stage IV disease. She was treated with surgical debulking and paclitaxel plus carboplatin for 6 cycles. She has been in remission since. However, arguably, the peritoneal nodules that were seen at the time of her pancreatic cancer presentation could have represented evidence of either disease.    She notes that she tolerated chemotherapy poorly on both occasions. She had a ***** in October 2019 and suffered pelvic fractures. These are still healing and she requires the use of a walker.    Her appetite is good and her weight is stable. She feels that she is doing as well if she ever has. She denies any pain. She does have constipation and uses senna.

ECOG November 16    RECOMMENDATION:    We reassured them that there are oncologists was doing ***** ***** job in ***** ***** should remain on the rucaparib as long as it was helping her. Her husband was hopeful that there was something better out there that would provide more long lasting benefit. Unfortunately there is not.    We did discuss need for resuming therapy in the future. Given her outstanding response to prior treatment, the usual maneuver would be to rechallenge with the same chemotherapy. She apparently did not tolerate it very well and that could be addressed with a change in schedule or dosing.    I spent a total of 50 minutes face-to-face 
 with the patient and 40  minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding all aspects of their care and management.

Patient Identification and Oncology History  ***** ***** ***** is a 71 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology practice at ***** ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.     Patient initially was diagnosed with prostate cancer and as a part of his staging scan was noted to have a pancreatic mass. PET/CT obtained on 09/01/16 showed a heterogeneous, ***** solid mass with calcifications in the left upper quadrant which appears to be arising from the pancreas measuring up to 12 cm. MRI abdomen obtained on 09/06/16 showed a mass measuring 12.0 x 6.2 cm within the body and tail of the pancreas, indeterminate in etiology, without associated lymphadenopathy, biliary or pancreatic ductal dilation, vascular involvement, or metastases within the abdomen.    Patient was evaluated by Dr. ***** on 09/06/16 when EUS guided biopsy was recommended. This was performed on 09/26/16 and revealed a large mass in the area of the pancreatic body and tail. The lesion measured greater than 6 cm in one plane. The overall size is much larger. Cytopathology from the FNA revealed adenocarcinoma.    A distal pancreatectomy, partial gastrectomy and splenectomy were performed on 10/19/16. Pathology from this revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in association with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (gastric foveolar type, with moderate dysplasia) measuring 12 cm mass in the pancreatic body. There was extension into the 
 peripancreatic soft tissues, but is not identified at surgical resection margins. No lymph nodes were involved with cancer (0/32).     12/07/16: CT cap- No evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease. Postsurgical changes status post distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy, including a small fluid collection anterior to the pancreatic head. Mildly enlarged gastrohepatic lymph node and fat stranding at the resection bed, nonspecific in the recently postoperative setting.    12/22/16: C1D1 of gemcitabine + capecitabine  01/13/17: ***** of gemcitabine + capecitabine  02/03/17: ***** of gemcitabine + capecitabine  02/24/17: ***** of gemcitabine + capecitabine  02/28/17: Established care with Dr. ***** and started ***** 120 mg sq  03/03/17: ***** not given due to low ANC (0.2)  03/15/17: CT CAP: No evidence of disease recurrence.  03/17/17: ***** of gemcitabine+capecitabine  03/24/17: ***** of gemcitabine+capecitabine  03/28/17: Lupron 22.5 mg IM  04/07/17: ***** of gemcitabine + capecitabine  04/14/17:   ***** CANCELLED gemcitabine + capecitabine (due to ANC 0.58), ***** x 3  04/21/17: ***** of gemcitabine + capecitabine (no ***** between days February 15 of cycle)  04/28/17: *****  DEFERRED gemcitabine + capecitabine (due to ANC 0.86), ***** x 3  05/05/17: ***** gemcitabine + capecitabine    Interim History  He had neck pain and join pain in the LE after the last cycle.

There was extension into the peripancreatic soft tissues, but is not identified at surgical resection margins. No lymph nodes were involved with cancer (0/32).     He was started on adjuvant therapy with gemcitabine combined with capecitabine per the *****-4 trial (***** et al Lancet Oncology 2017) on 12/22/16. Overall, he has been tolerating it well. His scans from 03/16/17 do not show any concerns of recurrence. His ***** was held due to low ANC (0.2) and he was given *****. We will plan to support him with Neupogen starting with this cycle. We are planning on 6 months total of adjuvant therapy.     We will proceed with ***** of chemotherapy 
 today:  -gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 (decreased due to low ANC)  -capecitabine 1500 mg po qam and 2000 mg po qpm on days January 22  cycle is 21 days    -continue Neupogen 480 mcg for 3 days after infusion to help with neutropenia. If he does not feel well after cycle 8, we will not proceed with cycle 9. Otherwise, he will proceed with cycle 9 and will leave for his trip on 06/13/17.    -Monthly CA 19-9 levels have been wnl range. We will obtain CT chest, abdomen and pelvis after the completion of adjuvant therapy.    -After the adjuvant therapy has been completed, the patient's disease can be monitored with surveillance CT scans and CA 19-9 every 3 months.     -Cancer Genetics appointment was on December 08; results of the genetic testing are negative.    #Prostate cancer: High-risk, September 29 cores positive, ***** 5+4. He established care with Dr. ***** on February 28 and started on ADT therapy with ***** on 02/28/17.   -Plan for surgical resection in September.    #Supportive care: Patient has supply of antiemetics.

176,Male,White,1932-08-09,"SUBJECTIVE  This is a very pleasant 87-year-old gentleman with a prior history of bladder cancer that incidentally was associated with a episode of pancreatitis. He was on surveillance for his bladder cancer when a mass in the tail of the pancreas was identified. Follow-up scan showed that the mass was progressing and on June 17, an EUS directed biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.    He was referred to us at that point. However, as his disease appeared to be resectable, we immediately referred him to Dr.***** who did a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Because of renal and splenic invasion, the left kidney and left adrenal and spleen were included in the resection. Margins were negative and 23 lymph nodes were negative. Tissue was MMR intact.    We recommended adjuvant therapy with gemcitabine and capecitabine. He has had 6 cycles and is on surveillance.     He is doing well. Energy level is good. Weight is stable. Appetite is good. No pain currently. Regular bowel movements. Slow urine stream secondary to enlarged prostate.    He had an episode of chest pain last Tues and called 911. Work up was unremarkable.

 am reluctant to recommend a clinical trial. I think she could tolerate a regimen of gemcitabine and capecitabine which would give her a good chance of disease control and some increase in her lifespan.  She is very realistic about her condition and understands completely the goals of therapy.  She is already indicated that if we cannot manage the side effects to her satisfaction, that she will stop therapy and enter a hospice program.  In all, I spent 40 minutes in face-to-face consultation with the patient, her husband and her son going over all aspects of her care and management.

178,Male,White,1954-09-11,"Dr. ***** is a 66 y.o. male who comes to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in consultation for his metastatic pancreatic cancer. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all his outside records.    History of Present Illness  This pleasant gentleman first noted upper abdominal discomfort radiating to his back in early January, which lasted several days to weeks. ***** provided some relief, and he suspected these symptoms may have represented alcoholic pancreatitis as his alcohol consumption had increased around that time. After he stopped drinking completely, the pain eventually subsided. He has had previous episodes of similar pain lasting a couple days and also subsiding after cessation of alcohol use.     During this most recent episode, he saw his gastroenterologist Dr. ***** ***** who ordered a CT abdomen (01/26/20) that showed a 3.3 x 3.1 x 2.2 cystic mass in the tail with surrounding fat stranding, with extension of the mass beyond the margin of the pancreatic parenchyma, where it abutted the undersurface of the gastric body. This was felt to be possibly c/w a peripancreatic fluid collection/pseudocyst in the setting of pancreatitis, vs a pancreatic cystic neoplasm. F/u MRI abdomen (03/22/20) showed a 4.1 x 2.8 cm unilocular cystic lesion in the pancreatic tail with a 5 mm mural nodule, at which time surgical consultation was recommended.    He was seen by Dr. ***** ***** of our Surgical faculty practice at ***** on March 27, who ordered repeat imaging (CT pancreas protocol). CT C/A/P (04/13/20) showed persistent visualization of the cystic mass within the pancreatic tail, as well as an indeterminate hypodense lesion in the posterior right hepatic lobe. This was followed by a PET-CT (04/28/20) confirming a complex cystic and solid mass in the tail of the pancreas (approximately 3 x 2 cm) with SUV 9.1, with features consistent with a primary pancreatic 
 carcinoma likely arising within intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm; as well as a solitary 2 cm hypermetabolic lesion in liver segment 7, SUV 7.0. He underwent a CT-guided liver biopsy on May 02, and pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin. CA 19-9, already noted to be elevated (530 on March 24) continued to rise (852 on 04/20/20).

COMMENTS:   The ***** are abundantly cellular and consist of loosely cohesive  clusters of malignant cells. The malignant cells are pleomorphic with  coarse chromatin, variably prominent nucleoli, and moderate amounts of  wispy cytoplasm. Intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles are present. The cell  block is concordant. Immunohistochemical stains are performed and  evaluated on the cell block (block A1) and show:     CK7:          Positive  *****:          Negative  *****:          Positive, suggests pancreaticobiliary origin  Albumin *****:     Negative, against intrahepatic primary  Hep-par:     Equivocal, difficult to interpret given numerous admixed  benign hepatocytes     The morphology and immunophenotype are consistent with an adenocarcinoma  of pancreaticobiliary origin. The negative albumin ***** argues against an  intrahepatic primary. This could be consistent with metastatic  adenocarcinoma of pancreatic origin. Clinical and radiographic  correlation is recommended.    I personally reviewed and interpreted the patient's relevant imaging studies in conjunction with the corresponding formal radiology reports, as follows:    PET-CT 04/28/20          CT C/A/P 04/14/20  FINDINGS: NONCONTRAST ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: No renal or ureteral calculus. No pancreatic calcifications identified. CHEST: The lungs are clear without infiltrate, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. No suspicious pulmonary nodules. The heart is normal in size 
 without pericardial effusion. Minor coronary artery calcifications are identified. No lymphadenopathy. There is curvature of the thoracic spine towards the left superiorly and towards the right inferiorly without acute osseous abnormality. ABDOMEN: The liver is normal in size, shape, and overall attenuation. The previously identified lesion at the posterior right hepatic lobe measures 2.2 x 1.3 x 1.7 cm without definite enhancement identified. No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation. The gallbladder, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. Within the pancreatic tail, there is visualization of a 3.2 x 1.8 x 2.1 cm cystic mass (11 *****) without enhancement identified (previously 3.3 x 2.3 x 2.5 cm at corresponding levels). The pancreatic duct measures up to 3.5 mm at the pancreatic body, which is mildly dilated. There is stranding within the peripancreatic soft tissues adjacent to the lesion. The kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis. There is a 1.1 cm cyst in the upper right kidney and a 1.1 cm hyperdense cyst in the upper left kidney. No bowel obstruction or inflammatory change. No pneumoperitoneum, ascites, or lymphadenopathy. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with calcified atherosclerotic change. No acute osseous abnormality. PELVIS: The bladder is unremarkable. The prostate ***** mildly enlarged. No free fluid or pelvic lymphadenopathy. No acute osseous abnormality.     IMPRESSION: 1. Persistent visualization of cystic mass within the pancreatic tail, measuring slightly decreased from prior CT. This may represent pancreatic pseudocyst given persistent surrounding stranding or cystic mass lesion. 2. Indeterminate hypodense lesion in the posterior right hepatic lobe, which does not show significant enhancement. In comparison to prior CT, this appears mildly increased in size. 3. Bilateral renal cysts.      MRI abdomen 03/22/20        Impression and Recommendations:  In *****, 
 *****. ***** is a 66 y.o. male with a new diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with biopsy-proven liver metastasis. He is in excellent shape overall (ECOG PS 0) with minimal cancer-related symptoms at present.    We discussed the details of his diagnosis and why the mainstay of treatment at this juncture should consist of systemic therapy with the goal of achieving as deep and durable a remission as possible, hopefully translating into significant prolongation of life, but that treatment was not expected to be curative. As such, it would be important to carefully weigh the risks/benefits of therapy and to prioritize ***** in the process. (Any consideration of locoregional therapies to the pancreas and/or liver, such as radiation or even surgical resection, are not appropriate at present but could conceivably be re-addressed down the road if he demonstrates a robust response w/durable disease control).     In terms of standard of care options, there are several possible chemotherapy regimens to select from for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of therapy depending on the patient's age, performance status, co-morbid conditions, and personal preference; phase III evidence supports either ***** (biweekly ***** 5-*****, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) or the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel as appropriate front-line choices. We discussed the logistics, scheduling, and some of the potential side effects of these respective regimens including but not limited to nausea/vomiting, alopecia, fatigue, cytopenias with resultant immunosuppression and/or anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy/cold sensitivity. He appears well enough to go with *****, which I would recommend as his first line of therapy.     In terms of front-line clinical trials for metastatic ***** at our institution:  - Newly opened: A Phase I trial of gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel plus *****-030, an anti-CD39 antibody 
 which decreases adenosine in the tumor microenvironment to enhance anticancer immune responses. Pre-treatment biopsy is required.  - For patients in the 1L/2L setting, as part of the national ***** Precision ***** clinical trials consortium: this is a platform trial that ***** molecular interrogation and rapid assessment of different treatment arms involving ***** therapies; at present, the first-line options involve randomization to SOC chemotherapy (either ***** or gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel). This trial is anticipated to open later this month.  - A multi-arm randomized phase Ib/II trial (***** pancreas) evaluating various *****-based combinations layered on top of gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel; the newest arm should be set to open in early 2021.    I did explain that if he does not respond to standard chemotherapy, we would also be happy to consider him for any later-line trials (pancreas-specific or early phase/disease agnostic) that we have available at that future time at *****.     After hearing the above, Dr. ***** wishes to proceed with SOC chemotherapy with ***** at *****. We will arrange for anti-emetic prescriptions and a chemotherapy teaching session with one of our practice RNs in anticipation of starting treatment in the next week or so; he will arrange to have the Mediport placed locally.    We also talked about making sure his archived tumor specimen, if there is adequate cellularity, be sent for molecular testing to assess for the presence of any actionable mutations or other genetic alterations that may inform future treatment options.  I did explain that while this information is always good to have, it will not necessarily yield useful clinical information for treatment purposes.  Additionally, we discussed germline testing to assess for any hereditary predisposition to cancer, as is now recommended for all individuals with a pancreatic cancer diagnosis, irrespective of 
 family history or known risk factors, as this would have screening implications for family members as well as potentially therapeutic implications for the patient himself. He agreed to have this done through our Cancer Genetics testing station; a member of our genetic counseling team will follow up with him regarding the test results, once available.    Finally, I brought up a couple of new non-therapeutic studies we have here at ***** for ***** patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease: (1) an MRI study for patients either prior to starting any line of treatment or already on treatment (P.I.: ***** *****), and (2) a microbiome study involving serial stool collections for patients starting 1L treatment at ***** (P.I.s: ***** *****, myself). Dr. ***** indicated a willingness to find out more about these studies and potentially participate; I will have the study coordinators of these trials (***** *****, ***** *****) reach out to him for screening and consent.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his and his wife's satisfaction.

After having right-sided abdominal pain for about 3 months, he underwent a CT scan on October 22 that showed an ill-defined mass in the pancreas. This was followed by an EUS with fine-needle aspirate that recovered adenocarcinoma. On November 17, he underwent a pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Pathology showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and measuring 5.0 x 5.0 x 4.0 cm. One of 25 lymph nodes were positive.    Postoperatively, he did quite well. When we initially saw him after surgery, he had evidence for a new solitary liver met. This was biopsied confirmed and he started on treatment with *****. He's completed 12 cycles and is now n treatment on a clinical trial of maintenance chemotherapy compared to vaccine. He was randomized to the chemotherapy arm and is on capecitabine. He has completed 3 cycles and is returning today for a followup CT scan evaluation.    He is having more discomfort on the right side of his abdomen. He occasionally takes Tylenol for this. Otherwise, his activity level and appetite is good. He's gained a kilogram. He denies any nausea. He has alternating constipation and diarrhea.   He has poor stamina during the second week of his chemotherapy with each cycle. He still has some peeling on the bottom of his feet and somewhat tender to walk.    Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.   Medication Sig    ACETAMINOPHEN (TYLENOL ORAL) Take 500 mg by mouth daily as needed.     aspirin 325 mg EC tablet Take 325 mg by mouth every 6 (six) hours as needed for Pain.    calcium carbonate (TUMS) 200 mg calcium (500 mg) chewable tablet Take 1 tablet by mouth 3 (three) times daily.    capecitabine (XELODA) 150 mg tablet Take 1 tab po QAM x 14 days on and 7 days off    capecitabine (XELODA) 500 mg tablet Take 2 tabs po QAM and 4 tabs po QPM x 14 days on and 7

182,Male,White,1940-01-20,"SUBJECTIVE:    This is a very pleasant 77-year-old gentleman with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with liver metastases. He's been having intermittent abdominal discomfort and occasional vomiting since February of this year. He developed worsening abdominal pain in March and went to ***** ***** ***** Hospital where a CT was done. This showed a hypodense mass in the head of the pancreas measuring about 3 cm and numerous hypodense lesions in the liver. He also had an incarcerated segment of small bowel noted in the left inguinal area. A core liver biopsy was done which revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma, CK 7 and CK 20 positive. It was also noted that the tumor was MSI high.    He underwent an inguinal hernia repair for this on April 29 at *****.    We initially saw him about one month ago. At that time, he has mild substernal discomfort and just takes extra strength Tylenol. He had lost 12 pounds. He had a very good appetite and he did not have early satiety. He was not sleeping well. He is normally quite active and plays golf and goes to the gym daily.    Because of his personal and family history, we were concerned that he may have a hereditary susceptibility for cancer. He was seen on the same date by genetic counselors and had rapid testing for DNA pathway genes and *****. These results were negative. The rest of his genetic testing is pending. As he had had a core liver biopsy, he was screened for the ***** trial but the material was insufficient for testing. He elected to start therapy with gemcitabine and Abraxane. He has now completed 2 cycles.    His course has been complicated by a number of events. Just prior to starting his chemotherapy, he developed biliary ductal obstruction. An ERCP was done and to metal stents were placed. Just after starting his chemotherapy, he developed a symptomatic DVT and this was managed with therapeutic Lovenox. He continues on anticoagulation. Also on cycle 1 
 day 8, he developed rigors and fever to 102 and was briefly hospitalized at ***** in ***** *****. No pathogens were identified and he was discharged on Augmentin. Because of this hospitalization, day 15 of cycle 1 was held.    His second cycle was complicated by the development of progressive fatigue and weakness. She now needs a walker to ambulate and a bedside commode. He is also developed generalized edema and peeling of his skin as well as mouth sores which are responding to ***** mouthwash. He also experienced fever to 101.9 and was again hospitalized on July 08. During that ***** infection was identified. A repeat CT scan showed an improvement in the size of the pancreas as well as diminished adenopathy. However, more ascites was described.    On the positive side, he is not having any pain. He is experiencing bladder and bowel urgency and has some incontinence. His appetite is poor. He has a history of asthma and felt that he was having problems from mount. He self started prednisone 2 days ago.

Progressive weakness, fatigue, and generalized water retention, possibly secondary to gemcitabine  5. Leukocytosis, possibly secondary to prednisone    PLAN:    I think we need to hold his chemotherapy to see if the symptoms resolve. We will get the images from his recent hospitalization to review here. By report, the results sound encouraging. His CA-19-9 after one month of therapy dropped by one half and we will have a new value later this week which also should give us 
 some direction. He is eligible for pembrolizumab and we can consider starting that at any time. I spent 20 minutes in face-to-face consultation with the patient, his wife and daughter today going over all aspects of his care and management. We also provided documentation for handicap parking.

Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 59 y.o. male with progressive metastatic *****, s/p 2 lines of chemotherapy (***** and the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, the latter received as part of the ***** study protocol of which he was randomized to the SOC control arm); now midway through cycle #2 of treatment on the crossover arm of the same ***** trial consisting of  the combination of atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor (administered on a q2 weekly schedule, i.e. days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle), together with cobimetinib, an oral MEK inhibitor (taken daily x 21 of 28 days). Thus far, he is tolerating treatment very well with no ***** or MEK-related toxicities, and maintenance of a generally good *****. He does have some bradycardia (baseline, ?slightly worsening on treatment -- not clearly attributable to either study drug) that does not necessitate holding either agent, but for 
 which I have referred him to be seen by Cardiology.    Review of his CT scans show essentially stable to slightly enlarging sites of his measurable lesions in the liver, with a slightly more cystic appearance. Formal ***** measurements are pending, but overall -- especially recognizing the potential for pseudo-progression with immunotherapy-based treatment and his stable clinical status -- I would like him to continue on study treatment at present, including cycle 2 day 15 of atezolizumab today. We will continue to monitor him closely with repeat CT scans at 6-week intervals.    At the point he progresses on this urgent regimen, we will need to explore further experimental options mostly in the form of disease-agnostic early phase trials if he is interested. Alternatively, although this is a somewhat outside-the-box approach, we could have him see Rad Onc for consideration of ***** of these limited, discrete sites of hepatic involvement.    The patient understands and is in agreement with the plan; he knows to contact me before his next scheduled visit should any concerning symptoms arise in the interim.

The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all his outside records.    History of Present Illness  This pleasant gentleman, previously entirely healthy, first noted diffuse abdominal discomfort a couple of months ago, with some accompanying loss of appetite and 10-lb weight loss. These symptoms gradually progressed, prompting diagnostic w/u to be undertaken, including the following:    - 09/21/2015: 3.3 x 2.9 x 3.3 cm pancreatic head mass with associated pancreatic duct dilatation; innumerable hepatic lesions up to 4 cm in size, some with small areas of probable internal hemorrhage with compression of IVC and right renal artery and vein   - 09/23/2015:  EGD/EUS: Large 32.2 x 39.7 mm size pancreatic head mass, associated with   small to large liver lesions consistent with metastatic disease (*****, *****, M1).

I agree with findings demonstrating a primary pancreatic head mass, as 
 well as extensive multifocal hepatic metastases.        Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 42 y.o. male with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer. I explained to the patient and his family why the mainstay of treatment at this point should consist of systemic therapy rather than surgery or radiation, and that the goals of such treatment treatment are to produce disease control/remission and hopefully extend survival, while possibly alleviating cancer-related symptoms, but that it is not curative in intent.    There are several possible SOC chemotherapy options for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of therapy depending on the patient's age, performance status, co-morbid conditions, and personal preference. The two current gold standards for front-line treatment (for patients who are well enough to receive combination chemotherapy), based on phase III data, include:    - ***** (biweekly ***** 5-*****, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin), which was shown in a phase III French cooperative group trial to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in terms of overall survival, PFS, *****, and other clinical outcomes. Side effects of this regimen were discussed, including but not limited to immunosuppression, risk of infection, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. I explained that this regimen requires placement of a Mediport due to the ***** component of therapy (48 hour infusion of 5-*****). Furthermore, because of the high incidence of grade _ neutropenia with this regimen, we tend to give primary prophylaxis with growth factor support (***** or Neupogen) after each treatment cycle.    - The combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, which was shown in a phase III international trial (*****) also to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy for patients with metastatic 
 pancreatic cancer. Side effects and logistics of this regimen were also explained.    If Mr. ***** wishes to proceed with SOC chemotherapy, I would go the route of *****, and will try to help coordinate his port placement and initiation of treatment closer to home ASAP.    Certainly clinical trials also represent an ideal option; we have two first-line trials here at ***** for which he may be eligible:    - The ***** trial, a randomized phase II trial evaluating the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel with or without *****-*****, a bispecific monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R and *****. For this study, patients are initially screened by measurement of serum free IGF-1 levels, as only those with high IGF-1 levels are eligible. The patient was provided a consent form ahead of time to review and has a clear understanding of the experimental nature of this clinical trial and the essential logistics of the study. He went ahead and signed consent today, so we may proceed with initial screening and see if he qualifies.    - We also have a second separate 1st-line trial evaluating the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel plus the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, which he could consider if he does not qualify for the *****-***** trial by serum IGF-1 level.    As the patient's wife was also very interested in learning about clinical trials using ***** as a chemotherapy backbone, I furthermore directed them to the ***** 1313 randomized phase II trial of ***** +/- the recombination hyaluronidase enzyme ***** that is ongoing in ***** and USC, although the logistics of travel and scheduling may make this prohibitive. Specifically, I do think it is imperative for Mr. ***** to get started on treatment sooner rather than later given his symptoms and burden of disease, so we will hopefully be able to move forward with one of the above options over the course of the next 1-2 weeks.    In the meantime, 
 I will also refer him to our Cancer Risk program to meet with one of our genetic counselors, given his young age at presentation and (+)FHx of breast cancer. I provided a new prescription for Zofran to use for nausea; and counseled him and his family on symptoms to watch for, including the potential for developing obstructive jaundice symptoms.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his and his family's satisfaction over the course of their 80-minute visit, the majority counseling him about his cancer diagnosis and the above treatment options.

She previously received gemcitabine/cisplatin and ***** back in 2013-14, and more recently was enrolled on a phase II trial of GM-CSF/pembrolizumab specific for biliary tract cancers. However, she had to be taken off study last month due to gradual, albeit relatively asymptomatic, disease progression, following 7 treatment cycles in total. We talked about restarting chemotherapy at her last visit before the ***** holidays but she wished to take some time to decide how she wished to proceed.    Interval history/review of systems  Due to evidence of some third-spacing, with ascites and a R-sided pleural effusion, she underwent both paracentesis (3400 cc) and R-sided thoracentesis (1000 cc) on 06/27/2016. Cytology from both of these fluid samples were benign.     She is increasingly fatigued and far less active than previously. She denies any frank pain. She has developed some jaundice symptoms, with ***** and generalized pruritis. She may have had some transient relief from the perspective of her breathing/cough and abdominal distention post-procedure, but these symptoms have since recurred. She tried Lasix for one week, but self-d/c'ed this b/c it caused some diarrhea (since subsided). Appetite is sluggish. She denies any fevers/chills.

Liver: There is a mass in the liver near the hilum. It is centrally necrotic with peripheral and central enhancing components. The cephalad portion of this has enlarged in the interval measuring 5.2 cm in diameter compared to 4.5 cm in diameter. The caudal portion extending into the caudate lobe measures 6.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 6.2 x 4.2 cm on prior study. The left lobe of liver severely atrophic.

BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious lesions.     1. Increasing right pleural effusion, now moderate to large. 2. New tiny bilateral pulmonary nodules which are indeterminate but may represent additional sites of metastatic disease.         Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 61 y.o. female with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, s/p gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and IMRT in the past; more recently participating on an immunotherapy-based clinical trial consisting of pembrolizumab q3 weekly plus GM-CSF during cycles 2 and 3. Treatment was well-tolerated w/o difficulty and no *****, but she ultimately had to come off study last month after showing *****-defined progressive disease. At present she shows more clinical evidence of disease progression, with more constitutional symptoms, recurrent third-spacing, and new-onset jaundice.    We discussed the following plan:    - Arrange for repeat paracentesis (+/- thoracentesis) with I.R; I explained 
 that we may have to repeat these periodically as needed for comfort. I did also instruct her to restart her diuretic if she can tolerate.    - Recheck labs today, including LFTs.    - Urgent referral to GI for ERCP/***** stent placement for biliary decompression.    - Once LFTs are trending downward (do not need to completely normalize) post-procedure, I again reinforced my recommendation that she start chemotherapy, of which I would favor ***** as the best option in this clinical setting. While she has previously been reluctant to pursue this, she was agreeable at this point to move ahead. We reviewed the logistics, scheduling, need for Mediport placement (for which I will place referral to I.R), and some of the potential side effects of this regimen including but not limited to nausea/vomiting, alopecia, fatigue, cytopenias with resultant immunosuppression and/or anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy/cold sensitivity.     - Of note, review of her Foundation One profiling results show, as perhaps her most actionable genetic alteration, an ***** mutation. We do have an ***** ***** inhibitor trial for *****-mutated ***** that we anticipate opening at ***** sometime in the next few months that may represent another option for her in the future, but I am concerned whether or not she would qualify on the basis of concurrent (albeit indolent) PNET.    I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and her husband, of which greater than 50% was spent in counseling regarding her cancer diagnosis. We will arrange for anti-emetic prescriptions and a chemotherapy teaching session with one of our practice RNs in anticipation of starting treatment ASAP.

187,Female,White,1954-11-25,"ATTENDING: ***** *****, MD     This is an independent visit    SUBJECTIVE:  This is a very pleasant 63 y.o. retired grade ***** from ***** with a diagnosis of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.    She presented in July 2018 with recurrent abdominal pain and loss of appetite as well as a 10 pound weight loss in one month. She was found to have diabetes. On 08/05/2018 CT scan was done which showed a mass in the pancreatic body and tail with indeterminate liver lesions. An EUS guided fine needle aspiration of the pancreas revealed adenocarcinoma.    Patient had initial consultation with Dr. ***** on 09/14/18 and she was recommended to undergo repeat imaging to determine the extent of her disease. Because patient may also have an inherited susceptibility to cancer we wanted to wait until we had a read out on her mutation status for DNA repair mutations. This has resulted and is negative to date.    09/23/18: Pancreas protocol CT reported an infiltrative mass in the distal pancreas results in near occlusion of the splenic artery and veins. Tumor interfaces along 180 degrees circumference of the ***** trunk and less than 180 degree of the common hepatic artery. Narrowing of the ***** venous confluence and upper SMV suggests involvement. Mass abuts the celiac celiac ganglion    09/23/18: MRI of the liver revealed  several hepatic hemangiomata and punctate simple cysts. Geographic regions of noncontrast retention on hepatobiliary phase, which are noncharacteristic for metastases.    10/11/18: Patient presented for consideration of C1D1 *****/Abraxane, however, given her symptoms, there was concern for gastric outlet obstruction and so treatment was held and she was advised to go to the *****.     *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: Admitted for possible GI obstruction. A CT abdomen/pelvis demonstrated a pancreatic body/tail mass invading the third portion of the duodenum causing high grade 
 obstruction  Of the stomach and proximal duodenum. A NG tube was placed to suction for decompression, draining about 1L of bilious material. On 10/12/18, patient underwent ERCP in an attempt to place a duodenal stent. However, the Hepatobiliary Service was unable to traverse the high grade obstruction with wire under fluoroscopic guidance.  On 10/13/18, a RUE PICC line was placed for upcoming chemotherapy and TPN, and on 10/14/18, patient underwent placement of a J-tube and a venting G-tube. On 10/18/18 she started C1D1 neoadjuvant gemcitabine/Abraxane. A CT chest on 10/22/18 revealed a linear filling defect noted within the right brachycephalic artery, likely sequela of a catheter associated thrombus. Again noted is occlusion of the right subclavian vein. Patient was started on apixaban.    10/28/18: CA 19-9 was 20,972  11/01/18: ***** *****/Abraxane   11/15/18: ***** *****/*****  11/15/18: CA 19-9 drops to 11,616  11/29/18: Patient presented for ***** but treatment was held due to concern for disease progression given her worsening symptoms. She underwent a CT CAP on 11/29/18 that showed stable disease.   12/06/18: ***** *****/*****  December 21/9: *****  01/03/19: *****. CA 19-9 = 7,092  01/17/19: C4D1  01/31/19: *****. CA 19-9 = 5,582  02/20/19: CT CAP with evidence of progression and increase in ***** 19-9, with paradoxic symptom improvement. CA 19-9 increased to 8,021. *****/***** was d/c.  02/28/19: C1D1 *****   03/09/19: Received 2 units PRBCs for HGB 6.9    Interim History:   Patient presents for consideration of *****. She did feel better following recent blood transfusion. She has improved energy. Her leg and abdominal edema slowly been decreasing. However, she does note a lot of GI gurgling and gas.

Liver: Hepatic steatosis results in geographic heterogeneous enhancement of the liver. Pneumobilia in left greater than right intrahepatic bile ducts, secondary to hepaticojejunostomy from ***** procedure.  Gallbladder: Not definitely visualized, may be decompressed.  Spleen: Unremarkable  Pancreas: Evidence of ***** procedure with pancreaticojejunostomy.  Adrenal Glands: Unremarkable  
 Kidneys: Unremarkable  Vasculature: IVC filter present. IVC is collapsed, consistent with dehydration.  GI Tract: Acute high-grade small bowel obstruction with likely transition point in the mid abdomen (axial series 2, image 191) coronal series 602, image 68). Bowel wall enhances uniformly, with no definite evidence of pneumatosis.  Pelvis: Unremarkable  Lymphadenopathy: Numerous prominent lymph nodes in the mesentery.  Ascites: Small to moderate ascites with mesenteric edema.  Bones: Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.      IMPRESSION:   1. Acute high-grade small bowel obstruction, with transition point in the mid ileum in the midline abdomen. No evidence of bowel ischemia.  2. Clusters of bilateral lower lobe, right greater the left, faint centrilobular nodules, which may represent infection or aspiration.  3. Status post interval ***** procedure.   (*****AK: note no evidence of early disease relapse).    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 61 y.o. male with a resected node-positive pancreatic cancer, now 2 months s/p ***** resection, with a prolonged period of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (***** --> gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel). He looks well at today's visit and has recovered well from last month's partial SBO. We discussed at length today his risk of disease relapse, including locoregional risk given the (+) uncinate margin and requirement for SMV reconstruction. As such, while I would not recommend any further adjuvant chemotherapy, I do think he would be a reasonable candidate to consider radiation treatment (with concurrent low-dose capecitabine as a radiosensitizer). We discussed some of the logistics and potential side effects associated with RT, including fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping; as well as the equivocal data supporting its use in the setting of resected *****. Regardless, he warrants evaluation and consultation at our Rad Onc faculty practice, to 
 whom I will make a referral.    Regardless of whether or not he opts to pursue radiation treatment, we discussed a plan for f/u surveillance to include CT scans and serum *****-9 measurements at approximately 3-4 month intervals at this point, spacing these out further over time if his cancer does not recur in the next couple of years. At his request, we will also arrange for removal of his Mediport and possibly his IVC filter.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his and his wife's satisfaction. Appropriate f/u will be arranged.

(*****+*****).    Oncologic history:  1989 - developed symptoms of chronic chest/abd pain, pericarditis, eventually diagnosed with lupus. Eventually symptoms resolved and she tapered off plaquenil.  2000 - diagnosed with pancreatitis, triglycerides >5000, unclear if might have had underlying tumor, but no imaging was performed at that time.   2009 - diagnosed with right heel melanoma, status post wide excision and negative sentinel lymph node biopsies.     September 2010: pancreatic NET  09/25/2010 - developed progressive abdominal pain and indigestion, prompting CT demonstrating 8 cm pancreatic tail mass. Biopsy consistent with intermediate grade PNET, ***** 12%, August 27 mp hpf. Underwent resection. Concern for liver involvement at that time, but intraoperative U/S demonstrated cystic nature of liver lesions. Also at the time, a ***** of the ovary was resected, benign    October 2010- recurrent melanoma--seen by ***** *****. Post-op scanning indicated right pelvic sidewall nodes, these were eventually identified as malignant melanoma.   February 2011 - present:  *****/***** combination for melanoma (on ***** trial)    July 2013 - provoked PE completed >6mo Lovenox    Last seen in med onc for PNET in  December 2012 --at that time  pt did have identifiable liver lesions c/w cystic lesions per ***** that did not have interval change *****. We did not elect for octreoscan or additional surveillance imaging given low risk of recurrence. Instead recommended CGA/pancreatic polypeptide and f/u in 6mo. Pt did not know she was supposed to f/u.    Regarding her metastatic ***** mutant melanoma (started on heel, 3 LNs in knee and 5 LNs in groin -> 2 years)  - has continued f/u with our cutaneous oncology dept, noted to have complete response to combination therapy, 
 no ***** per above PET  - continues on clinical trial, taking intermittent dabrafenib +***** ***** then trametinib alone *****, tolerating well.    September 2015 CT C/A/P: Multiple hyperattenuating liver lesions, two of which are new from 05/17/2015, are suspicious for metastatic disease. Additional hyperattenuating liver lesions are unchanged from the prior examination dated 05/17/2015 but are new when compared with PET/CT from 01/27/2015.    September 2015  Liver FNA: although the cytologic findings are atypical, the population of cells is  too small for definitive characterization; re-biopsy could be considered, as clinically  indicated.     12/28/2015 Petct Whole Body Vertex To Toes: 1. No evidence of FDG avid disease. 2. Allowing for differences in technique, no significant interval change of previously described hepatic lesions dating back to 2014.

Several foci of perceptible receptor uptake within the liver, compatible with ***** lesion seen on MRI. Similar in size and number to the enhancing liver lesions on the CT dated 12/28/2015 and concerning for metastatic disease. 2. Evidence of receptor positive metastatic osseous lesions within a mid left lateral rib, L1 and L3. 3. Findings of receptor positive metastatic disease in the region of the celiac axis, may represent a metastatic lymph node      02/24/16 LIVER MRI (part of *****-***** PET/MRI):  IMPRESSION: 1.  Since 12/28/2015, unchanged size of multiple peripherally enhancing hepatic metastases which again measure up to 2.6 cm. These lesions display somatostatin radiotracer uptake and are likely of pancreatic neuroendocrine origin as opposed to melanoma.  2. 
 Enhancing radiotracer avid lesions in the L1 and L3 vertebral bodies as well as a left lateral mid thoracic rib, consistent with osseous neuroendocrine metastases.  3.

COMMENTS:   The aspirate smears are 
 abundantly cellular and composed of monotonous  neoplastic cells arranged in loosely cohesive groups, focal  *****, and as isolated cells. The tumor cells are  small-to-medium, with moderate amounts of granular cytoplasm, and have  *****-placed, hyperchromatic nuclei with ***** stippled  chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Occasional large tumor cells are  present as is often seen in neuroendocrine tumors. Background, benign  hepatocytes are also noted. The cell block consists predominantly of  hepatocytes; however, given the patient's history of melanoma and a  pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, we attempted immunohistochemical stains  with the following results:    -Synaptophysin: Rare, positive cells.     -Chromogranin: Rare, positive cells.     -*****-A: Negative.  -*****-10: Negative.

190,Male,White,1963-02-19,"SUBJECTIVE:  Mr. ***** is a 55 y/o man with a h/o HTN and a recent diagnosis of early stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma who is referred for evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    Mr. ***** reports being in his usual state of health until the beginning of January when he started developing a reduced appetite, progressive jaundice and unintentional weight loss of about 20 pounds.  He presented to a local ED on February 19 and was found to have a  Tbili 9, AST 69, ALT 141, ***** 176.  ***** 02/18/18 CT A/P showed ***** and extrahepatic ductal dilation, CBD measuring 15 mm with an abrupt transition in pancreatic head, dilated pancreatic duct measuring up to 7 mm. This was concerning for underlying lesion such as a mass at the head of the pancreas. His CA 19-9 was 24.  An ERCP was performed (report not available) and a plastic biliary stent was placed. Brushings were reportedly performed that did not show any malignancy (cytology report not available for review).  After stent placement his Tbili improved to 5.1 as of 02/20/18.    On 03/04/18 he underwent an EUS by Dr. *****, which demonstrated a 28 mm mass in the head of the pancreas and SMV, a dilated pancreatic duct measuring 7mm with obstruction at the level of pancreatic head mass. A FNA of the pancreas head mass showed rare atypical cells in a background of pancreatitis.  Given high clinical suspicion for pancreatic *****, he was referred for evaluation at ***** ***** *****. *****.  At his March 25 Dr. ***** appointment,  Dr. ***** reviewed his imaging and believed the mass is surgically resectable since there does not appear to be any celiac or arterial or venous involvement.  He recommended repeating imaging, a repeat EUS and FNA for tissue diagnosis at *****, and then neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection.    On 04/03/18 a pancreatic protocol CT A/P showed a 1.9 cm mildly hypodense mass in the pancreatic head, with less than 180 degrees 
 of contact with the portal vein and mild focal contact with the superior mesenteric vein, and no arterial encasement.  A CT Chest did not show evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease.  On 04/07/18 he underwent an EUS and ERCP with Dr. *****.  The EUS showed a 2.9 x 2.5 cm mass in the head of the pancreas that involves the pancreatic duct and bile duct and appeared to involve the splenoportal confluence. Tissue was obtained for cytology.  ERCP showed intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with a stricture of the common bile duct. A metallic stent was deployed within the common bile duct.  Ultimately the cytology returned as positive for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, MSS.  The day following his biopsy he developed severe abdominal pain so on 04/08/18 he presented to an OSH ED. His lab tests revealed a mildly elevated lipase but no other significant abnormalities.  No imaging was performed.    Of note is his family history of malignancy.  His mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at age 64, died 65.  Father diagnosed with colon cancer at 70.  His Maternal Grandmother had colon cancer.  Paternal aunt with breast cancer, died at age 37, and his paternal grandfather had stomach cancer.  He has had germ line testing and this was positive for pathogenic APC mutation.    We initially saw him in April 2018 and recommended therapy with gemcitabine and Abraxane. He experienced a delay in starting treatment because of tumor ingrowth into his stent which required revision. He also presented for his day 8 of his first cycle with severe hypertension and a creatinine of 3.59. These problems eventually were controlled and he has completed 6 cycles of therapy. His last 2 cycles were given with alternate week schedule using fixed dose rate gemcitabine.    He was taken to surgery on 11/27/2018.He underwent a portal vein resection. Path report did show residual adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, with 8 of 23 lymph 
 nodes being positive. Tissue was MMR intact. His postoperative course was complicated by chylous leak and the drain was removed on 12/09/2018.    He's feeling quite well. He has no pain. His weight is stable. His appetite is good. He is having regular bowel movements. Energy level is better and he is back to work.    He does not express CA-19-9.

Pancreas, fine needle aspiration biopsy: Adenocarcinoma; see  comment.    COMMENTS:   There are sparse clusters of neoplastic ductal epithelium with mild to  moderate nuclear pleomorphism, irregular nuclear membranes and high n/c  ratios are in a background of acute inflammation and pools of mucin. 
   Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the status of DNA  mismatch repair protein expression on block A. The results in the tumor  cell nuclei are:    ***** expression: Present.   ***** expression: Present.  ***** expression: Present.  ***** expression: Present.    Expression for all four markers, in most cases, indicates that the DNA  mismatch repair proteins are intact. This result should be correlated  with the clinical presentation and family history to determine the need  for further work up for ***** syndrome.       ASSESSMENT:    1. Adenocarcinoma the pancreas. Status post neoadjuvant therapy with gemcitabine and Abraxane followed by resection  2. ECOG 0  3. Hypertension, better controlled  4. APC mutation carrier  5. Possible local recurrence    PLAN:    He may well have local recurrence but with the current coronavirus crisis, it will be difficult to work this up. As long as he is asymptomatic, we will watch this as hope that it represents delayed post op changes.    I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.    We'll see him again in 3 months for follow-up. I spent 20 minutes in face-to-face consultation with the patient today going over all aspects of his care and management.

191,Female,White,1957-02-13,"  Ms. ***** is a 63 y.o. female whom I am seeing at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her metastatic pancreatic cancer.    History of Present Illness, reviewed:  This pleasant woman was originally diagnosed with borderline resectable disease back in November 2014 and initiated chemotherapy with ***** in December 2014, which she received for 8 cycles in total through March 2015, with modest response of her primary pancreatic tumor on f/u imaging. She recalls treatment was very well tolerated overall, with minimal fatigue and only mild GI symptoms. Thereafter she received ***** 5 fractions@ *****, completing treatment on 04/29/2015. She was ultimately taken to surgery by Dr. ***** ***** at ***** ***** on 05/24/2015, where she underwent a classic ***** procedure. Final pathology was notable for residual moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with (+) marked treatment effect; (+) *****; (-) margins; and July 28 involved LNs.     She then relocated to the ***** ***** ***** and given her favorable response to neoadjuvant *****, received an additional 4 cycles of this same ***** late August 2015. After completing her final cycle, she was hospitalized from 4.21 - 09/08/2015 for what turned out to be an SBO. Imaging did not clearly show evidence of disease recurrence, and her obstruction was managed conservatively with NG tube decompression and PO restriction. One blood culture grew out Strep viridans but this was felt likely to represent a contaminant. She recovered well from this episode.    Follow-up CT scans in January 2016showed a growing (2.9 x 1.8 cm) enhancing soft tissue nodule adjacent to the ***** confluence and hepaticojejunostomy limb, concerning for local disease recurrence. EUS evaluation was quite reassuring, however, notable only for remnant pancreas with no abnormalities; the spleno-portal confluence was noted in the area of the anastomosis, along with 
 two loops of bowel in cross-section adjacent to the spleno-renal confluence at the level of the pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis, and overlapping bowel wall of the two adjacent loops of bowel, but no mass lesion nor any *****.    ***** scans in January 2017showeda concerning small hepatic lesion near the junctions of segments 2 and 4A, but I.R-guided biopsy of this area showed only scant benign hepatic elements with no evidence of malignancy. Repeat imaging (CT and MRI scans) from the end of February 2017 did not show any definitive evidence of measurable disease recurrence. Nevertheless, due to rising serum *****-9 levels, she opted to resume chemotherapy, this time consisting of the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, beginning on 04/02/2017. This was originally intended to be given on a three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule, but due to asymptomatic grade 3 neutropenia at cycle 1 day 15 her treatment that day was held (with a dose of ***** given), and beginning ***** #2 of treatment she was switched to a two-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule. F/u CT scans since then have demonstrated essentially stable ***** lesions that continue to be concerning but not definitive for metastatic disease. Her *****-9 levels gradually declined on treatment to WNL. After completing 6 months of chemotherapy, she proceeded to take a pre-planned chemotherapy holiday beginning in mid-September 2017.    Her *****-9 ***** ***** off treatment,***** growth in one hepatic lesion of indeterminate significance on CT scans from 01/29/2018, confirmed on MRI scan on 01/30/2018. Biopsy of this lesion (02/10/2018) confirmed a metastatic focus.On this basis, she was taken back to the O.R at ***** ***** on 04/02/2018 for L lateral liver resection of a 2.3 cm well- to moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with (+) perineural and lymphovascular invasion, 0/1 involved LNs, 
 and negative margins.    Imaging since then have shown no recurrent disease in the liver, but slowly growing sub-cm pulmonary nodules (right upper lobe (6 x 6 mm), right lower lobe (8 x 10 mm)). She was seen by Dr. ***** ***** of our Thoracic Surgical faculty practice who took her for robotic right thoracoscopic-assisted right upper lobe apical segment wedge resection (0.6 cm) and right lower lobe lateral/inferior basilar segment wedge resection (0.1 cm) on 06/23/2018; both of these specimens were c/w metastatic adenocarcinoma, with negative margins. Postoperatively, she did have a sizeable R pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis x 2 (benign cytology) that gradually resolved on its own.     After her operation, we opted for a period of time vigilant surveillance without immediate resumption of systemic therapy. However, her *****-9 levels gradually ***** upwards, with a CT scan performed here at ***** on 12/10/2018 showing growing tiny pulmonary nodules (sub-cm) as well as a slightly enlarging 1.3 cm hypodense liver lesion. On these bases, she resumed chemotherapy with the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel starting 01/06/2019, on a planned ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) with ***** prophylaxis. She continued treatment, aside from a 3-week treatment interruption early on for a ***** European cruise, through late May/early June, and was then taken back to the O.R at ***** ***** on 07/07/2019 for wedge resection of her liver segment VIII metastasis (1.3 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative margins). She made a very smooth postoperative recovery, and ultimately resumed chemotherapy with the same regimen as of 08/25/2019.

Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 63 y.o. female now 4-plus years s/p ***** resection of a node-positive pancreatic cancer, preceded by neoadjuvant ***** x 8 cycles (which she tolerated very well overall) and ***** with favorable radiographic and pathologic treatment effect (albeit still with significant residual disease at the time of surgery). She then received an additional 4 cycles of postoperative ***** (to complete 12 cycles in total), with treatment completed in August 2016.    She subsequently resumed ***** ***** ***** the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, based on a bump in her *****-9 levels and questionable hepatic lesions(non-diagnostic biopsy at the time). She received ***** a total of 6 months, with ***** her *****-9 tumor markers and reassuring findings on ***** ***** scans. She was ***** a chemotherapy hiatus starting *****, with a slight upward trend in her *****-9 levels while off treatment,and marginal growth in one hepatic lesion, this time biopsy-confirmed to represent a metastatic focus.    She then ***** of this liver lesion (March 2018), followed by pulmonary metastasectomy (June 2018) of two tiny, slowly growing R-sided lung nodules.    Based on rising *****-9 levels and CT scans in late November 2018 showing 
 findings of (relatively subtle) disease progression in lung and liver, she resumed chemotherapy with the same gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel regimen to which she responded well previously. She again showed good disease control on this regimen, and was taken back for a second liver operation (June 2019) for wedge resection of her isolated hepatic metastasis. She has since opted to resume chemotherapy with gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel, well-tolerated to date.    Postoperative scans have revealed no evidence of active disease in the liver and a slightly growing RLL pulmonary lesion (reviewed at ***** ***** *****; potentially c/w evolving scar tissue), unchanged in appearance on today's scans, as well as sub-cm L-sided lung lesions. Our Thoracic Surgical team has seen the patient and appropriately is not inclined to repeat pulmonary ***** at this juncture, although I think it is reasonable to leave this (vs *****) open as a future possibility.    I would suggest continuing with the same regimen and following her with repeat imaging in another 2-3 months' time, unless her *****-9 markedly rises in the interim. Assuming continued good disease control, we will want to continue re-addressing the incorporation of a chemotherapy holiday at some point.     We are also keeping in mind future clinical trial possibilities at ***** that may be options for her when she progresses more significantly (subject to change):    -  A study combining *****-paclitaxel and a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist in the 3L-plus setting for metastatic pancreatic cancer (anticipated opening: mid-2020).     - Other studies through our Early Phase Developmental Therapeutics and Cancer Immunotherapy Programs that have pancreas-specific ***** or at least are disease agnostic that allow enrollment of pancreatic cancer patients. These include several small molecule inhibitors; a *****-directed mRNA vaccine; and a shared neoantigen adenoviral/mRNA 
 vaccine (***** ***** required).    - The combination of trametinib plus hydroxychloroquine; there is some promising preliminary data with this *****/antimalarial combination in terms of inhibiting autophagy in pancreatic cancer. We are hoping to open this trial at ***** in conjunction with Univ of ***** in the first half of 2020, but the patient could potentially receive this combination off-label sooner than that.    Of note,molecular profiling results ***** original resected pancreatic tumor specimen, using our ***** platform, ***** (*****), *****, and ***** mutations, with no evidence of microsatellite instability; as well as Foundation One testing on her lung and liver metastases showing an identical profile. She has also previously undergone germline testing with no pathogenic mutations identified.    All of the patient's questions were answered to her and her husband's satisfaction. I am certainly happy to see her again at any point in the future at her request or as clinically indicated.

Interval development of scattered groundglass opacity in the right lower lobe which might represent foci of infection or hemorrhage and new consolidation in the left lower lobe with scattered foci of nodular consolidation in the right lower lobe concerning for pneumonia and/or hemorrhage.    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 39 y.o. female with pancreatic cancer 
 w/*****-***** *****, developed in the context of underlying cystic fibrosis, IDDM, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.After taking into consideration her significant medical co-morbidities ***** weighing the risks/benefits of therapy, we opted to proceed ***** chemotherapy with a ***** regimen. She is now s/p 4 treatment cycles (with a dose reduction of irinotecan beginning cycle #2), with her first 2 cycles c/b a hospital admission due to exacerbation of her CF and accompanying infectious complications.    Issues addressed at today's visit:    - Metastatic pancreatic cancer. We reviewed her most recent imaging studies which demonstrate findings concerning for a new liver metastasis, consistent with her rising *****-9 levels. I would like to biopsy the dominant liver lesion to confirm this diagnosis, but would recommend at this point holding current chemotherapy for the time being. We talked about likely needing to pivot to a gemcitabine-based regimen, of which I will try the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel on a ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle). I explained to her the logistics, scheduling, and some of the potential side effects of this new regimen including but not limited to nausea/vomiting, alopecia, fatigue, cytopenias with resultant immunosuppression and/or anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.     Unfortunately with her infectious complication risk and CF diagnosis, she does not currently represent an appropriate candidate for therapeutic cancer clinical trials.    - Infectious disease. ***** continue to coordinate care with colleagues from ***** and Pulmonary services, with strategy of prophylactic minocycline 100mg PO BID on days November 29 of each chemo cycle (during her expected count nadir) for MSSA suppression. Given sputum culture results and moderate exacerbation of respiratory symptoms prior to her last treatment cycle, 
 she was treated more aggressively with PO levofloxacin + IV cefazolin (anticipated through 12/14/2020).    Additionally, for aspergillus surveillance, she will also have q2 weekly blood draws for galactomannan, and CT scans of the chest q2 monthly (which we can align with her tumor response assessments).    - Cystic fibrosis. Transferred CF care to Pulmonary Medicine clinic at *****. In addition to continuing consistent pulmonary toileting at home for underlying CF, maintained on Symbicort --> Advair, *****, hypertonic saline, and 3x/weekly azithromycin. Appears ***** stable at today's video visit.    - Molecular testing (Foundation One) revealed APC and ***** (*****) mutations; microsatellite stability and TMB could not be assessed. None of these are specifically actionable at the present time. Germline testing to assess for any hereditary predisposition to cancer showed pathogenic mutations in ***** and CFTR.    - Symptom management/supportive care. Referred to our Cancer Center psycho-oncology program to help with coping mechanisms. Also seen at our our Symptom Management Service. For pain management: continues with long-acting morphine which is providing good pain control.      Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities.

193,Male,White,1944-04-03,"Subjective:     Mr. ***** is a 71 y.o. gentleman with a prior history of prostate cancer and a current diagnosis of metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. He originally underwent resection of a node-positive tumor with direct invasion into the peripancreatic fat and negative surgical margins on 10/07/2009. Postoperative *****-9 was 361. He was treated with adjuvant with fixed-dose rate gemcitabine and alternate week capecitabine, completed in April 2010. In August 2010, there was concern regarding a gradual rise in his *****-9 along with some subtle but progressive radiographic findings, including portacaval, paraaortic, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy. He was also found to have a right popliteal vein DVT on 10/07/11 which was managed with enoxaparin.  The patient was enrolled in a phase I clinical trial at our institution evaluating ***** plus IPI-926, an oral Hedgehog inhibitor, beginning in August 2010.  The patient required a dose reduction to his chemotherapy regimen starting with cycle 3. He completed twelve 14-day cycles of therapy, but he elected to stop his chemotherapy (last cycle in February 2013).  The patient remained on the investigational agent (IPI-926) until November 2012.  Interval surveillance imaging has showed no evidence of recurrent disease.  He's been noted to have a rising CA 19-9 but we have stopped measuring it.    He underwent a repeat ablation on October 05 for his chronic atrial fibrillation. He notes that during a cardiology workup he was found to have a blood sugar of over 300. This was repeated and it was around 150.    In December 2014, he surveillance imaging showed growth in involved lymph nodes. Because his course has been unusually indolent, we elected to biopsy one of the nodes to be sure we understood what we were treating. Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma. He has resumed treatment. He is being treated with gemcitabine and Abraxane. He has completed 8 cycles of therapy although 
 day 15 on cycle 1 was withheld because of thrombocytopenia. On Cycle 2, day 15 was also held because of a BS over 500 for which he was hospitalized. He is now on insulin. He completed his chemotherapy on an alternate week schedule with fixed dose rate gemcitabine.    When we saw him in September, we elected to start a chemotherapy holiday. He's been doing quite well. He has a good energy level and continues to play golf. He has a good appetite. His blood sugars are running in the 80-160 range. He is having normal bowel movements. He died denies any cancer related pain but he does have occasional muscle aching.    Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.

She also has an affected daughter who has had a leiomyosarcoma resected.    The history of her benign and malignant tumors is as follows.  September 1993, age 36, DCIS right breast, high-grade comedo carcinomatous-type, 2.5 cm  April 1995, age 38, infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast measuring 2.0 cm (*****, PR 10, DNA index 1.8, S-phase 4.5, EGFR 28, *****-*****, ***** negative, HER-2/neu positive), resected May 1995, age 38, left axillary node dissection with metastatic carcinoma in 1 of 15 nodes followed by Adriamycin and CMF followed by a course of radiation which was aborted early because of mastitis  September 1996, age 39, 6.1 cm sympathic leiomyoma of the uterus resected  December 1998, age 41, recurrence of symptomatic leiomyoma, 2 cm, resected  September 2000, age 43, keratoacanthoma, left cheek, resected  March 2001, age 42, pancreatic adenocarcinoma 1.5 cm with negative lymph nodes, resected followed by gemcitabine monotherapy with poor tolerance to chemotherapy  March 2001, age 42, splenic hamartoma identified  March 2003, age 44, bilateral parathyroid adenoma is, resected  August 2000, age 49, adenocarcinoma NOS, left lower lung, 1 cm, EGFR positive, well-differentiated, resected  December 2008, age 51, colon leiomyoma, resected  August 2011, age 54, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, left upper lobe lung, well-differentiated, resected  September 2013, age 56, cutaneous pyogenic granuloma and dermatofibroma  , 2015, left superior parathyroidectomy, hypercellular parathyroid  September 2017, age 60, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, probable 2nd primary    Interim history:  She comes in today because of the new finding of recurrent or a new primary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. She had her usual screening at the NIH with whole-body EMR. This suggested some pancreatic abnormality and a 
 dedicated MR of the abdomen was done which showed a dilated pancreatic duct. She underwent an EUS study with an EUS directed biopsy and this revealed a 2.2 x 1.7 cm mass in the remnant pancreas as well as peripancreatic lymph node measuring 7.7 x 9.5 mm. She was seen by Dr.***** felt she would benefit from chemotherapy prior to an attempt at resection. She has been started on ***** and has received 4 cycles. She is tolerating it well.

Patient Identification and Oncology History  ***** ***** ***** is a 61 y.o. female who presents to our GI Oncology practice at ***** ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with peritoneal carcinomatosis.     Patient initially presented to ***** Community Hospital with loose BM, weight loss, abdominal pain and jaundice on 11/16/15. She was found to have elevated LFTs/hyperbilirubinemia (t.bili 8.7). An abdominal ultrasound was obtained which revealed intra- and extrahepatic biliary dilatation with a poorly defined hypoechoic mass in the region of the distal common duct and head of the pancreas. CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained on 11/16/15 which revealed a pancreatic mass in the head and uncinate process measuring 3.8x5.2x4.1 cm. The mass was noted to ***** the proximal duodenum and duodenal invasion. There was also moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No lymphadenopathy was noted.     ***** EUS was performed on 11/18/15 which showed an irregular mass in the uncinate process of the pancreas measuring 2.6x2.6cm. The interface was seen between the mass and the *****, *****, PV, SMC and splenoportal confluence suggesting lack of invasion. There was 1 peripancreatic lymph node which was malignant appearing (measuring 12mm). FNA of the pancreatic mass was consistent with well-to-moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A stent was not placed in preparation for a surgery. She was seen by Dr. ***** on 11/18/15 when surgery was 
 recommended.    CT abdomen with pancreatic protocol was obtained on 11/25/15 showed the pancreatic head mass with abutment of the superior mesenteric vein with less than 90 degrees contact and probable preserved fat plane between the mass and vein. There was no contact with the SMA. There was additional 2.4 x 1.5 cm hypodense structure medial to the mass may represent a metastatic lymph node versus medial extension of the mass and abutment of the proximal right renal artery, with a preserved fat plane. There were additional prominent periportal nodes measuring up to 14 x 11 mm which were nonspecific. An enhancing lesion at the lateral interpolar region of the right kidney measuring 2.0 x 1.8 cm, suspicious for renal cell carcinoma was also noted.    She was evaluated by Dr. ***** who recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

 placement.    She received neoadjuvant ***** in the setting of a borderline resectable pancreatic cancer and completed 12 cycles with dose modification/delays due to thrombocytopenia.  She underwent ***** procedure on 08/18/16. The pathology review of the surgical specimen showed grade 3 treatment response indicating that there was minimal treatment response to the neoadjuvant *****.     Post-operatively, she presented with worsening abdominal distention, increased fatigue and BLE edema. *****, ***** scans were concerning for ascites with suggestion of peritoneal enhancement (no nodules), lymphadenopathy with some of the lymph nodes encasing vessels in celiac trunk and mesenteric root. She was admitted for an expedited work-up and had paracentesis. Cytopathology from the paracentesis revealed 3 cells that were morphologically similar to her tumor.     A repeat CT abdomen was obtained on 10/17/16 and revealed ascites with areas of peritoneal enhancement of the pelvis, however with slightly increased omental stranding in the left upper and lower quadrants as well as increased infiltrative retroperitoneal soft tissue in the portocaval region which were suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis. In addition, CA 19-9 has increased to 1008 indicating progression of disease.     She was started on therapy with gemcitabine + capecitabine on 10/20/16. Cycle 1, day 8 was delayed due to cytopenias. She was admitted on cycle 2, day 3 for constipation. She has continued to decline clinically during this time period with decline in her PS, weight and worsening ascites.     During today's visit, I had a long conversation with her and her husband regarding goals of care. I shared with them my concern regarding her clinical decline and the most recent symptoms related to disease progression. I informed them that she is not strong enough to tolerate the gemcitabine combined with capecitabine and that we may even consider 
 discontinuation of chemotherapy to reduce the risk of potential complications related to chemotherapy. She stated that she was not ready to stop chemotherapy yet. For this reason, we decided that we would try gemcitabine monotherapy for one more dose and re-evaluate after that. If she is recovering well from the hospitalization and she is gaining back her strength, weight and performance status, we may consider continuing (if the chemotherapy is effective). Otherwise, we all agreed that we may consider discontinuation of chemotherapy. I provided her and her husband with opportunity to ask questions and I believe that I was able to answer all of their questions to satisfaction.    She will tentatively be scheduled to receive gemcitabine next week:  -gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15     We will plan to get CT chest, abdomen and pelvic after 2 months of therapy and CA 19-9 monthly.    #Ascites: She was previously on spironolactone and furosemide but was found to have dehydration when she was admitted. I offered to place a referral to IR today for consideration of a paracentesis. She will let us know if she would like to proceed with it.   -Consider IR referral for therapeutic paracentesis  -***** consider starting low dose furosemide and spironolactone (if the renal function allows)    #Renal lesion: concerning for RCC. However, we have decided to prioritize the management of pancreatic cancer.     #Supportive care: She will be seen in ***** clinic after her visit with me today. She will continue with protein supplements for weight gain. I recommended that she continue to stay active while undergoing therapy.    She will return to ***** ***** in clinic in approximately 2 weeks. There are other unrelated non-urgent complaints, but due to the busy schedule and the amount of time I've already spent with her, time does not permit me to address these routine issues at today's visit. I've requested another appointment to 
 review these additional issues. I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 40 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, symptoms and therapeutic options. As always, the patient was counseled to contact the clinic or the after-hours physician on call for any new symptoms or complications in the interim between now and her follow up visit with me.      ***** *****, MD, MS  Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine  Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology   UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center

196,Female,White,1935-11-24,"Subjective:    This is a very pleasant 79-year-old woman from ***** ***** presented with nausea in July and progressed to abdominal pain. She saw her PCP who ordered a routine CT scan of the abdomen. This showed small or dense lesions in the head of the pancreas and some prominence of the pancreatic duct. She was then referred to ***** ***** who performed an EUS and a fine-needle aspiration which confirmed adenocarcinoma. The EUS interpretation suggested that she had SMA encasement. The biopsy recovered a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.  .  When we initially saw her in consultation, we were concerned that she might have metastatic disease. We did repeat a pancreas protocol CT scan and this confirmed a diagnosis of locally advanced disease. We started her on an alternate week fixed dose rate gemcitabine with capecitabine. She is now received two cycles. She initially had difficulty with skin tenderness on her fingertips and with blisters on her lips which were thought to be related to herpes simplex. She has been treated with acyclovir. However between the lip blisters and tenderness in her fingertips, she received incomplete dosing with capecitabine during her first cycle. Her second cycle, we reduced her capecitabine dose by 20%.     Despite this, she was still unable to complete her capecitabine during the third cycle and it was held on day 16.     Currently, her abdominal pain is well-controlled on Norco. She complains of a low energy level and feeling cold all the time. She still has some peeling on her fingertips especially in the flexor areas. She has some mild nausea which responds to Zofran. She has a good appetite. She has one to 2 soft formed bowel movements daily.    Since we last saw her, a port was placed.    Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.

197,Female,White,1951-09-10,"SUBJECTIVE:    This is a very pleasant 67-year-old woman with a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. She began having symptoms in August of this year. Eventually, a CT scan was done on October 12 which showed a mass in the body and tail of the pancreas and liver metastases. Liver biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma, MMR intact. She ***** ***** M.D. ***** for treatment and was started on *****. After 4 cycles of therapy, CT scan showed progressing disease. Her CA-19-9 did not decrease but also did not increase during the treatment.    Molecular profiling was not done on the biopsy specimen but she did have a liquid biopsy which showed FGFR3 fusion, *****, *****, SMAD4 mutations.    We initially saw her about 2 months ago. We recommended therapy with gemcitabine and Abraxane. Right after we saw her, she developed very progressive ascites. As this required frequent *****, we had a ***** catheter placed so she could drain it at home.    After 2 cycles of therapy, she had evidence of benefit radiographically along with a nice decline in her CA-19-9. However, she was having a lot of difficulty with nausea and vomiting, early satiety and low caloric intake. We elected to give her a 2 week chemotherapy holiday to see if that would improve.    She also had evidence for right hydronephrosis. We referred her for stent placement. She had complications with bloody urine afterwards but this is much improved.    She returns today for follow-up. She is a bit better but is only taking in about 700 cal a day. In addition her albumin is 1.8. She is still draining about 2 L of ascites every 2-3 days. Pain is in good control.

The distal coil is just within the urinary bladder at the UVJ. Mild right  hydronephrosis is seen. The left kidney is atrophic. A stent is seen in the duodenum without findings of complication though assessment is limited. No findings suggestive of bowel obstruction are seen. Marked ascites is present. ***** ***** curvature seen in the lumbar spine. A catheter is seen in the mid abdomen.     1. Limited assessment of the pancreas due to the lack of IV contrast. The duodenal stent appears grossly normal. 2. There are low-density masses throughout the liver concerning for metastatic disease. A low-density focus is also seen in the spleen. 3. There is possible cholelithiasis. 4. There is extensive ascites. Small bilateral pleural effusions are present right larger than left. 5. A right renal stent is noted.

If not, we will place an NG tube for tube feedings. We probably should plan for jejunal placement of the tube. If that's helpful to her, we can consider a PEG tube for more permanent access.    Once we can get her albumin up to 2 or better, we can resume her chemotherapy.    I spent 20 minutes of face-to-face consultation with the patient and her husband and her sister going over all aspects of her care and management.

198,Female,White,1955-09-30,"Subjective:    This is a very pleasant 59-year-old Iranian woman whose first language is *****. She understands English but she is also having her visit interpreted by her sister. She began having pain in September of this year. Eventually, she went to the emergency room and an abdominal ultrasound showed a mass in the pancreas. A subsequent CT scan showed a mass in the head of the pancreas and gallstones. On April 05, an EUS directed biopsy confirmed a mass along with encasement of the celiac artery and portal vein. Fine-needle aspiration showed adenocarcinoma.    She was started on modified *****. She has had 3 cycles of therapy. After 3 cycles, her CT scan suggested stable disease. Her CA 19-9 over a six-week period showed no decline.    When we initially saw her, she was doing very poorly with unrelenting back pain. She was on short acting narcotics and apparently did not tolerate ***** *****. She had a very poor appetite and had bloating. She was experiencing  constant nausea despite Zofran and Compazine. She had lost 17 pounds since starting chemotherapy.  She was in bed virtually all the time and slept most of the day. She was eating very poorly and requiring IV hydration.    We recommended a time out to address her symptoms. She had a celiac block, was placed on RTC narcotics. At that point pain was much better controlled and her nausea was improved with Zofran. She was no longer having diarrhea. . Appetite was still poor and she was still in bed quite a bit. She resumed reduced dose *****. She had 2 additional cycles.     When we last saw her, her CT scan showed local progression only. We recommended SB RT. It is taken some time to line this up as they were initially uncomfortable with going to ***** and now have elected to come to UCSF. She saw the radiation oncologist, there was some concern about metastatic disease. A PET/CT scan was done and this was indeterminate for metastatic disease. She 
 is noted to have a right pleural effusion and a small amount of ascites. Neither of these are symptomatic problems for her. After review of these findings, a decision was made to proceed with radiation. She is scheduled for placement of fiducials tomorrow. Her radiation is not scheduled to begin until the second week of September.    Her pain is reasonably well controlled on fentanyl and oxycodone but she is very fatigued. She has poor appetite. She's noticed increasing lower extremity edema. She is constipated from her narcotics and is using a stool softener.

There is an area of mild focal increased uptake which correlates to the descending colon and may relate to a diverticulum. Unchanged moderate intrahepatic biliary and pancreatic ductal dilation. Sequela of superior mesenteric venous occlusion from tumor, including splenorenal shunt, gastric and paraesophageal varices, and dilation of the left gonadal vein. Diffuse anasarca. Calcified cholelithiasis.  Musculoskeletal:   No metastatic disease.     1. No significant change in the pancreatic neck mass with ***** SUV 5.6, with other abdominal findings which are grossly unchanged compared to 07/26/2015.  2. Interval development of a right pleural effusion and small to moderate free fluid in the pelvis both of which demonstrate low level FDG uptake. There is mild peritoneal thickening, though no definite soft tissue nodularity is seen. While the possibility of malignant ascites is a consideration though; for definitive evaluation, direct sampling may be considered if clinically indicated.  This study was reviewed by attendings Dr. ***** ***** from ***** ***** and Dr. ***** ***** ***** of Nuclear Medicine.    END OF IMPRESSION:     Assessment:    1. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, LAD, with improved symptom control, no evidence of chemotherapy benefit based on CA 
 19-9 levels and imaging  2. New pleural effusion and ascites, cannot rule out pleural and peritoneal metastases  3. ECOG     Plan:     The family is still questioning about whether radiation is the right route to go. I really do not feel that she is currently a candidate for chemotherapy. I think this is the most important option right now and should help with her symptom control. If she is able to reduce her narcotics she might be able to have more energy and could become a candidate for chemotherapy in the future. I spent 30 minutes in face-to-face consultation with the patient and her family today going over these principles of management and urging them to proceed with treatment.

199,Male,White,1968-06-10,"SUBJECTIVE:    This is a very pleasant 49-year-old gentleman with a new diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma the pancreas diagnosed in December 2017. He presented with a two-month history of weight loss and progressive epigastric discomfort. He presented to the emergency room and was worked up. CT scan showed a mass in the head of the pancreas along with liver lesions. He was also found to have biliary ductal obstruction. An ERCP was done on December 26 and a metal biliary stent was placed along with a plastic stent in the ***** pancreatic duct. Diagnosis was made with a fine-needle aspirate of the pancreas revealing adenocarcinoma. An FNA was also done of one of the liver lesions but the results were indeterminate.    He elected to start treatment with ***** in January 2018 and has now completed 4 cycles. He is also seeing an alternative care specialist in ***** ***** and receiving some oral mushroom extract along with IV vitamin C. We have asked for notes from these visits but have not received them.    He has also transitioned to a vegan diet and has lost 9 kg. He is recumbent most of the day. He has occasional discomfort in his back and stomach and tightness in his neck. He is experiencing cold sensitivity from his chemotherapy and this is constant and his fingertips. His nausea is responsive to Zofran. He is having formed bowel movements. He did not stop and have his laboratory work done today.

Metastatic adenocarcinoma the pancreas with progressing disease  2. Possible inherited susceptibility to cancer  3. ECOG 0    RECOMMENDATION:    He needs a change in his management. We are recommending gemcitabine and Abraxane. He is considering about whether he wants to do that or whether he wants to stick with alternative care. We advised him not to mix the two. We are comfortable with any decision 
 that he makes. We are also uncomfortable that he has changed his diet and has lost so much weight. We've asked him to relax that a bit and hopefully gain some of his weight back.    I spent 20 minutes in face-to-face consultation with the patient, his wife, and multiple family members going over all aspects of his care and management.
