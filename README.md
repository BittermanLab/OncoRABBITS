# Comparing Knowledge and Sentiment about Drugs: Preferred vs Generic Names
This project aims to analyze and compare the knowledge and sentiment about drugs when referred to by their preferred names versus their generic names.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to understand how the perception and understanding of a drug can change based on whether it's referred to by its preferred name or its generic name. 

## Data
The data used in this project is sourced from the HemOnc database of approved cancer drugs. This comprehensive database provides a wealth of information about various cancer drugs, including both their preferred and generic names.

## Methodology
We use GPT-4, the latest version of OpenAI's powerful language model, for evaluation. The model is prompted with questions about preference, sentiment, and knowledge about the drugs. The responses are then analyzed and compared based on whether the drug was referred to by its preferred name or its generic name.
