Malignant neoplasm of overlapping sites of right breast in female, estrogen receptor positive (CMS code)  NM Whole Body Bone Scan    MR Brain with and without Contrast    Complete Blood Count with Differential    Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (BMP, AST, ALT, T.BILI, ALKP, TP, ALB)    Cancer Antigen 15-3    Carcinoembryonic Antigen    Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time    Prothrombin Time    Ambulatory Referral to Integrative Medicine       History of Present Illness:   56 year old female diagnosed in May 2013 with a multifocal Stage IIA right breast cancer.  She had a mastectomy with sentinel node and implant reconstruction in June 2013 and had  2.3 and 2.4 cm tumors found with a negative sentinel node.  The tumors were G2,  ER and PR positive and her 2 neu negative.  She did not have radiation or chemotherapy and declined tamoxifen.  She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. \\n ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.  We discussed how treatment would be palliative but that treatment could improve her quality of life as well as length of life.  She asked me multiple times if this can be cured.       I will refer her to the ***** center.  I also ordered a MRI of brain and bone scan as well as labs to complete her work up.

No further adjuvant therapy given and patient declined tamoxifen.   2.  Metastatic relapse of her breast cancer.  She needs tissue confirmation and we will complete her staging work up.    3.  Appointment with Dr. ***** on Thursday to biopsy mass in right axilla in the office.   4.  RTC with me after completed work up to formulate a plan.  If she is HR+/ her 2 negative on biopsy will recommend palbociclib and *****.    5.

She had a mastectomy with sentinel node and implant reconstruction in June 2013 and had  2.3 and 2.4 cm tumors found with a negative sentinel node.  The tumors were G2,  ER and PR positive and her 2 neu negative.  She did not have radiation or chemotherapy and declined tamoxifen.  She has had ***** but no other imaging since her diagnosis for screening and was treated at *****.     She reports feeling discomfort and pressure in her waist and back for a few months and nausea and burping for a week.  She went to the ER and had a CT scan which shows widely metastatic cancer.  She has involvement of the lungs, peritoneum, liver and ovary with a local recurrence near the right axilla and implant.  She takes a long list of supplements which she will send to me.  She wants to have natural therapies.  She is very scared and appears anxious.  Her husband is here and very supportive.  We discussed how we need to get a biopsy to evaluate the phenotype of the cancer and she is agreeable.  I will set her up to see Dr. \\n ***** this week for a biopsy of the right axilla in the office.  We discussed how treatment would be palliative but that treatment could improve her quality of life as well as length of life.  She asked me multiple times if this can be cured.       I will refer her to the ***** center.  I also ordered a MRI of brain and bone scan as well as labs to complete her work up.

Right axillary adenopathy with 1.8 cm spiculated mass along  superolateral margin of right breast implant, suspicious for  regional recurrence.    3. Multiple small pulmonary nodules, right greater than left,  likely metastatic.    4. Large anterior right and left lobe hepatic masses likely  metastatic.    5. Peritoneal carcinomatosis with omental *****, nodularity, and  small possibly malignant effusion.    6. Mildly enlarged and hyperdense ovaries which could reflect  breast metastases to ovaries.    7. Appendix distended with fluid without associated inflammatory  wall thickening. A mucocele of the appendix would be a  consideration.    8. No CT evidence of osseous metastasis.     Psychologic/emotional well-being/support  She is distressed.  She has good support from her husband who is here today.     Assessment / Plan:    1.

No further adjuvant therapy given and patient declined tamoxifen.   2.  Metastatic relapse of her breast cancer.  She needs tissue confirmation and we will complete her staging work up.    3.  Appointment with Dr. ***** on Thursday to biopsy mass in right axilla in the office.   4.  RTC with me after completed work up to formulate a plan.  If she is HR+/ her 2 negative on biopsy will recommend palbociclib and *****.    5.  I will ask the nurse to send her information about the treatment.   6. ***** ***** Referral asap.          ***** ***** *****, MD  Medical Oncology/Hematology    TIME SPENT: 75 minutes examining patient, reviewing chart, coordinating care, discussing with patient and/or family.     \\n   \n",

ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** ***** is a 61 y.o. female who presents to our GI Oncology  practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for a follow-up visit of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with peritoneal carcinomatosis.Her initial course was complicated by recurrent cholangitis requiring multiple ERCPs and plastic biliary stent \n",
      " placement.    She received neoadjuvant ***** in the setting of a borderline resectable pancreatic cancer and completed 12 cycles with dose modification/delays due to thrombocytopenia.  She underwent ***** procedure on 08/18/16. The pathology review of the surgical specimen showed grade 3 treatment response indicating that there was minimal treatment response to the neoadjuvant *****.     Post-operatively, she presented with worsening abdominal distention, increased fatigue and BLE edema. *****, ***** scans were concerning for ascites with suggestion of peritoneal enhancement (no nodules), lymphadenopathy with some of the lymph nodes encasing vessels in celiac trunk and mesenteric root. She was admitted for an expedited work-up and had paracentesis. Cytopathology from the paracentesis revealed 3 cells that were morphologically similar to her tumor.     A repeat CT abdomen was obtained on 10/17/16 and revealed ascites with areas of peritoneal enhancement of the pelvis, however with slightly increased omental stranding in the left upper and lower quadrants as well as increased infiltrative retroperitoneal soft tissue in the portocaval region which were suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis. In addition, CA 19-9 has increased to 1008 indicating progression of disease.     She was started on therapy with gemcitabine + capecitabine on 10/20/16. Cycle 1, day 8 was delayed due to cytopenias. She was admitted on cycle 2, day 3 for constipation. She has continued to decline clinically during this time period with decline in her PS, weight and worsening ascites.     During today's visit, I had a long conversation with her and her husband regarding goals of care. I shared with them my concern regarding her clinical decline and the most recent symptoms related to disease progression. I informed them that she is not strong enough to tolerate the gemcitabine combined with capecitabine and that we may even consider \n",
      " discontinuation of chemotherapy to reduce the risk of potential complications related to chemotherapy. She stated that she was not ready to stop chemotherapy yet. For this reason, we decided that we would try gemcitabine monotherapy for one more dose and re-evaluate after that. If she is recovering well from the hospitalization and she is gaining back her strength, weight and performance status, we may consider continuing (if the chemotherapy is effective). Otherwise, we all agreed that we may consider discontinuation of chemotherapy. I provided her and her husband with opportunity to ask questions and I believe that I was able to answer all of their questions to satisfaction.    She will tentatively be scheduled to receive gemcitabine next week:  -gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15     We will plan to get CT chest, abdomen and pelvic after 2 months of therapy and CA 19-9 monthly.    #Ascites: She was previously on spironolactone and furosemide but was found to have dehydration when she was admitted. I offered to place a referral to IR today for consideration of a paracentesis. She will let us know if she would like to proceed with it.   -Consider IR referral for therapeutic paracentesis  -***** consider starting low dose furosemide and spironolactone (if the renal function allows)    #Renal lesion: concerning for RCC. However, we have decided to prioritize the management of pancreatic cancer.     #Supportive care: She will be seen in ***** clinic after her visit with me today. She will continue with protein supplements for weight gain. I recommended that she continue to stay active while undergoing therapy.    She will return to ***** ***** in clinic in approximately 2 weeks. There are other unrelated non-urgent complaints, but due to the busy schedule and the amount of time I've already spent with her, time does not permit me to address these routine issues at today's visit. I've requested another appointment to \n",
      " review these additional issues. I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 40 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, symptoms and therapeutic options. As always, the patient was counseled to contact the clinic or the after-hours physician on call for any new symptoms or complications in the interim between now and her follow up visit with me.      ***** *****, MD, MS  Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine  Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology   UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center      \n",

Patient Identification and Oncology History  ***** ***** ***** is a 71 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology practice at ***** ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.     Patient initially was diagnosed with prostate cancer and as a part of his staging scan was noted to have a pancreatic mass. PET/CT obtained on 09/01/16 showed a heterogeneous, ***** solid mass with calcifications in the left upper quadrant which appears to be arising from the pancreas measuring up to 12 cm. MRI abdomen obtained on 09/06/16 showed a mass measuring 12.0 x 6.2 cm within the body and tail of the pancreas, indeterminate in etiology, without associated lymphadenopathy, biliary or pancreatic ductal dilation, vascular involvement, or metastases within the abdomen.    Patient was evaluated by Dr. ***** on 09/06/16 when EUS guided biopsy was recommended. This was performed on 09/26/16 and revealed a large mass in the area of the pancreatic body and tail. The lesion measured greater than 6 cm in one plane. The overall size is much larger. Cytopathology from the FNA revealed adenocarcinoma.    A distal pancreatectomy, partial gastrectomy and splenectomy were performed on 10/19/16. Pathology from this revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising in association with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (gastric foveolar type, with moderate dysplasia) measuring 12 cm mass in the pancreatic body. There was extension into the \n",

I discussed with the patient the natural history and treatment of Stage ***** *****+/*****- breast cancer.  We reviewed her pathology and imaging reports.  I explained that there is a small, but serious risk of distant, metastatic recurrence even after optimal local control, which can be reduced with the addition of anti-estrogen therapy that is given to eradicate micrometastatic deposits of tumor. I explained that the standard, first-line recommendation for adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy in a post-menopausal patient with *****+/*****- breast cancer is an aromatase inhibitor (*****), which blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen, reducing the total body estrogen supply. I discussed the typical side-effects, including hot flashes, arthralgias, vaginal dryness, and bone density loss. I recommend that she take an ***** for at least 5 years.     She will need a DEXA at this time to assess her current bone health. We discussed ways to improve her bone health, such as weight bearing exercise. She will also take calcium and \n",
      " vitamin D. We also discussed the importance of aerobic activity (150 minutes a week).    I expect that she will proceed with radiation.  We will plan on meeting again once her radiation course is complete to review DEXA and plan her ***** start.  She stated clear understanding and was in agreement with this plan.       Recommendations in *****:  - proceed with radiation oncology consultation; ***** ***** she will have radiation  - obtain DEXA   - calcium/vitamin D  - aim to resume her daily aerobic activities    RTC after radiation course is completed    I spent a total of 90 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.  \n",

Tentative start date is 12/16/18. We discussed the role of endocrine therapy today. She start an aromatase inhibitor after she completes radiation. She has decided to proceed with a bilateral oophorectomy with Dr. *****, so she may not require ovarian suppression. Dr. ***** also discussed she may be eligible for the ***** trial with ribociclib that should open around the time she completes radiation.    2. Pulmonary nodule: Baseline PET/CT in April 2018 showed a non-specific 4 mm pulmonary nodule. Her CT Chest in August 2018 was stable. Consider a follow up CT Chest in one year.     3. Low weight, improved: We encouraged her to continue efforts to gain weight. Continue small, frequent meals a day and Ensure protein shakes. Continue to trend weight. Follow up with nutrition on 11/30/18.    4. Anxiety: She continues to struggle with anxiety though she states this is slightly improved. Encouraged her to follow up with her local therapist. She was prescribed Lexapro previously but has not taken it.    5. BRCA1 mutation: S/p bilateral mastectomy. She will see Dr. ***** on 12/02/18 to discuss bilateral oophorectomy.     6.

We also addressed her ongoing neck pain which she now feels is related to how she is sleeping as a result of her bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction. She understands that ***** ***** head obtained at outside hospital was negative but we cannot obtain MRI with tissue expanders in place.    We have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories and spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 30 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options.

Nonspecific 5 mm enhancing lesion within the right upper sternum,   without apparent correlate on ***** ***** of 11/11/2020. Recommend   correlation with bone scan or PET/CT.  4. Suggestion of enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, which appear   more prominent in comparison to the prior CT of 11/11/20, although   comparison is limited due to differences in technique. Suggest   correlation with CT or PET/CT.    12/31/20 PET/CT: 1. Baseline PET/CT demonstrates hypermetabolic right breast   mass consistent with known invasive ductal carcinoma. Associated   hypermetabolic right axillary, right internal mammary, and possible right   anterior chest wall metastases.  Additional extensive fat stranding along   the right upper extremity neurovascular bundle raises the possibility of   brachial plexus involvement.   2.  Extensive hypermetabolic bilateral hilar and mediastinal   lymphadenopathy in a pattern most suggestive of sarcoidosis versus less   likely metastatic disease.   3.  *****-shaped hypodensities within the left greater than right kidneys,   favoring pyelonephritis versus less likely developing infarcts. Mild   circumferential urinary bladder wall thickening also may reflect urinary   tract infection. \n",

She is here to discuss systemic therapy options.     We had a lengthy discussion with the patient in which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. We reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. We discussed the use of \n",
      " locoregional therapies to reduce risk of locoregional disease and the use of systemic therapies to primarily reduce risk of systemic disease. Informed her that locoregional breast cancer is curable and that the goal would be to reduced her risk of developing systemic disease, which can potentially be incurable. Based on the currently available information, she seems to have a locoregional disease but needs to be confirmed with staging CT scans, which we have ordered today.    Because she has HR+ disease, she will need at least 5 years of hormonal therapy. Data from *****/TEXT trial demonstrated that patient who were premenopausal at their breast cancer diagnosis and recovered ovarian function after completion of chemotherapy, the combination of ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor was superior to tamoxifen in terms of preventing distant recurrence particularly in those under 35. Thus, would favor *****+*****, regardless of chemotherapy. We reviewed possible side effects from *****, including but not limited to urogenital atrophy, vasomotor symptoms, and musculoskeletal/joint stiffness or pain.

We also discussed the importance of exercise in helping to alleviate this symptoms.     We reviewed data from ***** trial which evaluated 5,015 patients with stage II/III breast cancer, March 30 involved nodes, and a RS ? 25. Patients were assigned to receive either endocrine therapy or endocrine therapy plus standard chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 5.1 years, there was a significant association between chemotherapy benefit and menopausal status (P = .004). The absolute benefit in this cohort was 5.2% at 5 years for disease free survival.

Her postoperative course was complicated by E. coli bacteremia, intra-abdominal abscess (Clostridium perfringens) requiring IR drainage and IV antibiotics; ileus requiring a temporary period of TPN; and occasional PRBC transfusions for drifting hematocrit with no evidence of active bleeding postoperatively.     She did ultimately recover from these complications and was well enough to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine beginning 06/14/2016, on an intended three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule. However, treatment had to be held after her first dose 2o to progressive transaminitis and alk phos elevation (with normal total bilirubin) and then an E. coli bacteremia, ***** hospital admission at *****. Abdominal U/S and CT scan showed only stable mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation without evidence of abscess, and clinically she continued to appear very well overall. She was covered with IV ertapenem --> switched to ceftriaxone, which she continued for 2-week course at home (per ID recommendations), completing it in mid-June, with repeat blood cultures thereafter showing no growth.     She ultimately re-started chemotherapy on 07/19/2016 (representing cycle #2), and received her full treatment cycle on a three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule w/o difficulty. Then, beginning cycle #3, based on recently presented *****-4 data demonstrating a benefit from the combination of gemcitabine plus ***** in this adjuvant setting, we added capecitabine to her regimen at a dose of 1500 mg QAM/1000 mg QPM on days January 20 of a 28-day cycle. However, a week after starting she developed fevers, diarrhea, stomatitis, N/V, fatigue, and abdominal pain for which \n",
      " the capecitabine was held following a total of 6 days. As there was some concern of a melanotic component to her diarrhea, she was ultimately hospitalized at ***** ***** on 09/02/2016. EGD showed anastomotic ulcers for which she was started on a PPI. Stool studies were negative for infection, including C diff.     She was again readmitted to ***** ***** x 4 days from 9.16 - 09/18/2016 with high fevers 2o to an enterococcal bacteremia from a UTI, rx'ed with a course of PO antibiotics (amoxicillin), which she remains on to the present time. Due to these recurrent infectious complications, I referred her to ***** for consultation, but we agreed that there was no clear indication for suppressive antibiotics.    She has since resumed chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine, and has now completed 3 more cycles of monotherapy on a three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule, to bring her to a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy altogether. Her last dose ***** 12/20/2016.    Interval history/review of systems  Doing well overall, with an uneventful holidays. She continues to use ***** as she notes occasional oily stools. Appetite is excellent. She has had no recent fevers or intercurrent infectious complications. She denies any abdominal pain.

Status post ***** without evidence of local disease recurrence or metastatic disease within the abdomen and pelvis.        Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 71 y.o. female s/p ***** resection of a node-positive pancreatic cancer, recently completing adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine (could not tolerate the combination of gemcitabine/capecitabine), with multiple and varying infectious complications along the way, not routinely in the context of neutropenia and with no consistently reliable source each time. Her last few cycles were more uneventful after she was simplified back to single-agent gemcitabine.    Recent surveillance imaging studies are reassuring for the absence of early disease recurrence. We will continue a plan for continued careful monitoring with repeat CT scans and labs again in an additional 3-4 months' time, recognizing her very high risk of relapse. We will keep her Mediport in place until her next visit and then plan to remove it at that time if she remains free of disease, arranging for monthly port flushes in the interim. Ms. ***** understands and is in agreement with this plan.     I spent a total of 25 minutes face-to-face with the patient, of which greater than 50% was spent in counseling regarding her cancer diagnosis.    \n",

The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all outside records.    History of Present Illness     This pleasant gentleman initially presented with painless jaundice after several months of weight loss (approximately 100 lbs over the past 6 weeks). An abdominal ultrasound was obtained on 01/15/21 which showed intrahepatic biliary dilatation and mild dilatation of the pancreatic duct along with 3.4cm partially exophytic pancreatic head mass. On 01/16/21, CT abdomen was obtained which showed 2.1 x 1.9 x 1.8 cm hypodense mass pancreatic head concerning for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Resultant moderate intrahepatic and extrahepatic ductal dilatation with more normal caliber distal CBD near the ampulla of *****. Mild dilatation pain pancreatic duct in the pancreatic head up to 4 mm. Nonocclusive thrombus is observed within the superior mesenteric vein as it extends cephalad into the confluence with SMV. Main portal vein, intrahepatic portal branches, celiac axis, SMA remain patent. Borderline size peripancreatic lymph nodes measuring 9 mm.  ?  On January 18, ERCP/EUS was performed and revealed a pancreatic head mass measuring ***** leading to distal biliary stricture and upstream pancreatic and biliary ductal dilatation. During the procedure, a biliary stent was placed. FNA from the biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.  ?  PET/CT obtained on 01/30/21 did not reveal distant metastatic disease. Surgical oncology consultation was on February 05 with Dr. ***** when neoadjuvant chemotherapy was recommended. He was evaluated by Dr. ***** 02/05/21 when recommendation for low \n",

CT pancreas protocol was obtained today and showed ill-defined pancreatic head mass with celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery being clear of tumor involvement. No definite involvement of the superior mesenteric vein. Slight interval decrease in size of superior mesenteric vein nonocclusive thrombus compared to prior scan. Small portion of this thrombus at its inferior aspect is nearly occlusive. Mildly enlarged peripancreatic lymph nodes, nonspecific and unchanged compared to prior examination. No evidence for distant metastatic disease.  He was seen by Dr. ***** today and the recommendation was made for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.     He is on a wheelchair today- he states that he is using wheelchair to reduce the risk of falls as he feels unstable. He has been experiencing neuropathy for several years but has not been evaluated for a potential underlying etiology. Gabapentin helps with the neuropathy. He states that he has mostly been less active due to exacerbation of gout and neuropathy lately. The last time he was active was in November - he used to play with his grandchildren. He had constipation and took senna and colace for a week before he was able to have a BM. He had decline in his appetite which is slightly improving s/p bilary stent placement.

However, Dr. ***** believes that the resection may possibly require a segmental vein resection. As the patient has a thrombus in the vein, there may be potential complications related to that. For this reason, *****. ***** recommends *****/neoadjuvant chemotherapy to increase the chance of an ***** resection.  ?  During today's visit, we reviewed the potential systemic treatment options including gemcitabine monotherapy, \n",
      " gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel and *****. I reviewed that the highest chance of cure for pancreatic cancer is with surgery. So, our treatment goal is to increase the chance of him going to surgery for a successful resection by providing ***** chemotherapy. Due to his marginal performance status and neuropathy, ***** would be too toxic and may cause more harm than benefit in his treatment course. In addition, due to his declining activity level, my recommendation for systemic therapy is to proceed with gemcitabine monotherapy to determine if he will tolerate this. I would then recommend adding *****-paclitaxel with subsequent doses if he is able to tolerate gemcitabine monotherapy.     I informed him of the potential side effects of the regimen which may include : fatigue, nausea, vomiting, alopecia, diarrhea and neuropathy, myelosuppression, increased risk of infections, bleeding and requirement for blood transfusions (with addition of *****-paclitaxel).      I recommend monitoring treatment response with monthly CA 19-9 levels and restaging CT scans with contrast every 2 months (CT abdomen to be with pancreatic protocol). I would recommend obtaining baseline labs including CA 19-9 on the first cycle of chemotherapy. I reviewed that CT pancreatic protocol can be reviewed at every 2 months to consider when surgery may potentially be possible. I also encouraged him to increase his activity level as much as possible and decrease the risk of further deconditioning so that he can be stronger for potential surgery.    He has met with our genetic counselors and the genetic testing is currently pending. They are quite interested in learning about complementary medicine and I will place a referral to our ***** Integrative Medicine Center for their evaluation and recommendations.

      "Mr. ***** is a 64 y.o. male who comes to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in consultation for his resected pancreatic cancer. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all his outside records.    History of Present Illness  This pleasant gentleman is from ***** ***** has received all of his care to date there. He initially presented last March with weight loss, nausea, abdominal pain, and scleral icterus and was found on laboratory tests to have elevated LFTs, including a total bilirubin of 7.4, AST/ALT of 624 and 661 respectively, and an alk phos of 447. Imaging studies included MRCP (04/18/2017), showing a focal mass lesion in head and uncinate process of the pancreas (46x26 mm) obstructing the lower end intrapancreatic portion of CBD and MPD; and CT scan(04/21/2017) confirming a 3.3x2.5x3.8 cm mass in the pancreatic head causing both pancreatic and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, with suggestion of SMV invasion.     He was taken directly to surgery on 04/24/2017, consisting of a classical pancreaticoduodenectomy (*****) on 04/24/2017. Final pathology revealed a 2.2x2.1x2 cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative margins and 0 of 9 involved LNs.    Post-operative course was notable for an intraabdominal abscess requiring percutaneous drainage. He was eventually discharged home on 05/15/2017, tolerating limited oral nutrition (some rice and soup) but also receiving supplemental feeds via an enteral feeding tube (600ml/day).      He was eventually able to start on adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of single-agent gemcitabine on 06/11/2017 originally intended to be given on a three-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule; however, this was subsequently switched to a two-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule due to cytopenias and for better tolerability.

Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 64 y.o. male from *****, now 5 months s/p ***** resection of a node-negative pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He is currently in the midst of his course of adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine (simplified schedule-wise to a two-week-on, one-week-off dosing schedule), which I affirmed is an entirely appropriate treatment strategy and which he appears to be tolerating adequately thus far. Given his margin-negative surgery, as well as the debatable role of adjuvant radiation for resected pancreatic cancer, I would not recommend RT in his particular circumstances.    We will resume his care while he is here in the United States with the same dose and schedule of chemotherapy, beginning next week (09/24/2017). He will receive 2 treatment cycles here, and then return to ***** ***** his planned final cycle (#8).     I discussed at length with him and his family ancillary/supportive care measures during this time, in terms of diet and exercise; we reviewed and simplified his medication list; and we talked about plans for long-term monitoring after completion of his adjuvant therapy, as well as his overall prognosis. All of their questions were answered to their satisfaction.    \n",

      "Mr. ***** is a 70 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his metastatic pancreatic cancer, originally diagnosed in March 2013 after presenting with progressive abdominal discomfort. CT scan at that time demonstrated a 3.9 cm pancreatic tail necrotic mass, extending into the splenic hilum and abutting the stomach, with surrounding stranding in the fat which extends toward the L kidney and splenic flexure of the colon; with encasement of the splenic artery. Also noted were adjacent LNs 9 mm in size; cystic liver lesions up to 3.6 cm in size; small free fluid in the pelvis with pelvic/peritoneal nodules up to 1.4 cm in size; nodular thickening along greater curvature of the stomach; and L ureteral obstruction 2o to a 2.3 cm retroperitoneal nodule causing moderate hydronephrosis. Endoscopic FNA of the pancreatic mass on 03/27/2013 confirmed adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent ureteral stent placement on 03/28/2013.     Initial treatment consisted of *****, to which he responded well with interval imaging demonstrating reduction in both his primary tumor and measurable distant sites of disease. However, he did develop some cumulative cytopenias and peripheral sensory neuropathy ultimately requiring holding of the oxaliplatin beginning with cycle #6. He then continued with ***** alone, with an eventual spacing of his dosing schedule to q3 weeks. Between the ***** and the *****, he completed 18 cycles in total through February 2014.     Following his initial consultation with me in February 2014, I suggested he meet Dr. ***** of our Surgical faculty practice to discuss his surgical options, given the absence of measurable metastatic disease on his most recent CT scans and excellent durable disease control. Repeat imaging here at ***** on 05/22/2014 confirmed only the presence of an ill-defined hypodense pancreatic tail mass measuring approximately 2.0 \n",
      " cm, without measurable disease elsewhere in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. However, the ultimate decision at ***** ***** ***** was not to pursue a surgical approach, given the extent of his peritoneal disease preoperatively.     He was on a chemotherapy holiday for 8 months, with serial imaging showing relatively stable disease but the patient noting some increasing abdominal pain toward the end of 2014. On this basis, he restarted chemotherapy with ***** in October 2014 and received 9 cycles in total. Most recent CT scans on 03/03/2015 showed minimal change/slight enlargement in his pancreatic tail mass, extending into the stomach, L kidney, proximal descending colon, and splenic hilum, with splenic vein occlusion/gastric varices; as well as stable sub-cm peritoneal metastases.    At the last visit we discussed various options for further treatment, including immunotherapy-based clinical trials. The patient is interested in the possibility of participating in a clinical trial and returns today to discuss this further. He has not received any further chemotherapy in the meantime.    Interval history/review of systems  - Feeling well overall, no major complaints  - Staying active, playing tennis and riding his bike regularly (ECOG PS 0)  - Appetite reasonably well-maintained, weight stable  - Abdominal pain had initially disappeared when he resumed chemotherapy, although more recently he notes occasional bilateral subcostal discomfort, for which he has just restarted taking hydrocodone within the last week.  - Some residual peripheral sensory neuropathy from original *****, unchanged  - No fevers/chills, cough, SOB, rash, dysuria, N/V/D.

      " Antigen Latest Range: NEG  NEG       Most recent imaging:  CT C/A/P performed following today's visit, which was personally reviewed and interpreted by us; formal radiology reports still pending. We appreciate a persistent pancreatic tail mass, lower abdominal peritoneal metastases, and multiple new scattered pulmonary nodules most likely representing new pulmonary metastatic disease, sub-cm in size.    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 70 y.o. male with metastatic ***** diagnosed 2 years ago, s/p front-line therapy consisting of ***** --> simplified to *****, which he has received for a prolonged period (including two separate courses of *****) with relatively minimal progression radiographically. He has been off of chemotherapy now since the end of February and while he maintains an excellent ***** overall with relatively minimal symptoms and overall low burden of disease, he is showing modest disease progression. We discussed his various options at this point, not including resuming *****/***** which remain a viable possibility.    (a) SOC treatment with a gemcitabine-based regimen, such as the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel  (b) a randomized phase II trial of CRS-207, an attenuated mesothelin-expressing Listeria vaccine, with or without *****, vs standard single-agent chemotherapy (which in case I would opt for gemcitabine) -- currently open and *****;  (c) a randomized phase II trial of the aforementioned CRS-207/***** combination +/- the anti-PD1 mAb nivolumab (to be open w/i next 1-2 weeks); or  (d) a randomized phase II trial of ACP-196 (a BTK inhibitor) +/- the anti-PD1 mAb pembrolizumab (not yet open).     After much consideration and discussion re: the above, including logistics and the randomized trial designs, he would like some time to consider the above clinical trial options, in particular options (b) and (c).  Given that the trial of CRS-207/***** \n",
      " combination +/- nivolumab (option c) is scheduled to open in the coming weeks, and does not contain a chemo-only randomization arm, Mr. ***** is somewhat attracted to this option. He is, however, hesitant about the required biopsy for entry into this trial, of which we would likely obtain the biopsy from one of his peritoneal metastases. We have gone ahead and placed an interventional radiology consult to have the IR team evaluate whether this would be a viable strategy.     The patient has our contact information and will let us know how he would like to proceed. Once we hear from him, we will arrange for further screening for eligibility and likely starting within the next few weeks.    Of note, his labs today were notable for pyuria on UA. He did not report any dysuria or f/c, and therefore we have ordered a repeat UA and urine culture for his next visit to re-evaluate.      I spent a total of 35 minutes face-to-face with the patient, of which greater than 50% was spent in counseling regarding his cancer diagnosis.    ATTESTATION:      My date of service is 04/21/2015.  I was present for and performed key portions of an examination of the patient and am personally involved in his management. I agree with the findings and care plans as documented.     ***** ***** *****, MD  PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL MEDICINE  GASTROINTESTINAL ONCOLOGY    \n",

Assessment and Recommendations:  54 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of a Stage I (*****) *****+/*****- IDC of the right breast, who will benefit from adjuvant radiation and an adjuvant aromatase inhibitor x 5 years.    I discussed with the patient in great detail the natural history and treatment of Stage I HR+/*****- breast cancer.  We reviewed her imaging and pathology reports.  She did not have a *****; it is not clear to me, but \n",
      " it is possible that Dr. ***** performed lumpectomy alone because she was thought to have a tubular carcinoma which carries a lower risk?  It is not clear to me what the value of a lymph node biopsy would be at this point, but I will reach out to Dr. ***** to clarify.  Additionally, I noted that it was strange how her biomarkers (on her pathology report) were reported >50% for ER and PR - generally the degree of positivity would be more exact.  I will see if there is a way to speak with her pathologist.  .     I explained that there is a small, but serious risk of distant, metastatic recurrence even after optimal local control, which can be reduced with the addition of anti-estrogen therapy that is given to eradicate micrometastatic deposits of tumor. I explained that the standard, first-line recommendation for adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy in a post-menopausal patient with *****+/*****- breast cancer is an aromatase inhibitor (*****), which blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen, reducing the total body estrogen supply. I discussed the typical side-effects, including hot flashes, arthralgias, vaginal dryness, and bone density loss. I recommend that she take an ***** for at least 5 years.  I stated that she would start this after radiation.    She will need a DEXA to assess her current bone health. We discussed ways to improve her bone health, such as weight bearing exercise. She will also take calcium and vitamin D. We also discussed the importance of aerobic activity (150 minutes a week), which she does appear to currently achieve through daily walking.    Finally, she has not had a breast MRI.  She has extremely dense breast tissue.  We should have a conversation with her breast surgeon about surveillance breast MRI moving forward.    Recommendations in *****:  - proceed with radiation oncology evaluation  - plan to treat with aromatase inhibitor; would check estradiol level  - obtain DEXA  - will speak with Dr. \n",

The most common adverse events were neutropenia, anemia, and fatigue. We also reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with aromatase inhibitors including but not limited to arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss/fractures, and discussed strategies to mitigate these side effects.

Since she has extensive bony mets and new pain, we recommend obtaining new scans and ordered MRI of total spine and CAP CT. We will request her outside PET/CT for comparison. We also discussed that in patients with breast cancer with bone metastases, use of bone modifying agents reduce the risk of skeletal related events.

Agree with findings demonstrating localized pancreatic mass at time of original diagnosis. The patient also had a recent CT scan on 10/21/2015 showing post-op changes, without evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 50 y.o. male now 5 months s/p ***** resection of a node-positive pancreatic adenocarcinoma, currently receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. He started with the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, but due to cumulative neuropathy and asthenia, he has now appropriately backed down to gemcitabine alone, which I would advocate he continue with to complete his full 6-month course of adjuvant therapy in total. We discussed the following additional issues at today's visit:    - While there is fairly incontrovertible evidence that systemic therapy improves survival for resected pancreatic cancer, the role of adjuvant radiation is much more debatable, with mixed data to support its use. There is a current cooperative group trial (RTOG 0848) that seeks to answer this question, but we would not expect a readout for at least a few more \n",
      " years. I generally reserve radiation for fit patients who are at particularly high risk of locoregional recurrence (R1 resection, large primary tumor), and suggest waiting until after completion of systemic therapy before considering this modality rather than the 'sandwich' approach. On the whole, for Mr. *****, I do not see any specific features that would warrant offering chemoradiation after he completes his current chemotherapy.    - He was also interested in what additional therapeutic interventions might be offered after completion of his chemotherapy, including clinical trial possibilities. At present, we have none to offer him here at *****. While prior vaccine-based approaches (as ***** following standard adjuvant treatment) have been looked at in this post-resection setting at ***** and ***** *****, without clear evidence of benefit, I am not aware that any such studies are actively ***** at this time. I will contact my colleagues at these institutions to double-check and let the patient know is there is anything he may qualify for.    - Otherwise, we talked about a surveillance strategy after he completes his current treatment, including CT scans and bloodwork at ***** 3-4 month intervals, gradually spacing these surveillance studies out to less frequent intervals as time ***** and his risk of relapse diminishes after the first couple of years. Treatment at the point of relapse would depend on his pattern of recurrence, including radiation (standard or *****) for locoregional-only relapse, vs systemic therapy and possible clinical trials were he to develop evidence of metastatic disease.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his satisfaction. I am certainly happy to see him again at any point in the future at his request or as clinically indicated.    \n",

History is obtained from the patient as well as from the review of old records.    Patient initially presented in May 2012 with abdominal discomfort in ***** and epigastric regions. A CT abdomen obtained in June 2012 noted a 5.6x2.9x2.4 cm mass involving the body and tail of the pancreas with encasement of the celiac axis, splenic vein and splenic artery. EUS was performed on 07/25/12 and FNA revealed adenocarcinoma (CA 19-9 was 313). ***** was started for locally advanced disease and he completed 4 cycles (completed in September 2012). He tolerated it well except for neuropathy. On 10/20/2012, his CA 19-9 level was noted to be 1067.    On 10/22/2012, a cholecystectomy, subtotal pancreatectomy, splenectomy with resection of celiac axis and part of superior mesenteric vein, with bovine patch reconstruction of superior mesenteric vein (***** procedure) was performed. Pathology revealed ductal moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 cm with perineural and lymphovascular invasion. June 31 lymph nodes were involved by direct extension and the AJCC stage was ***** *****. He received adjuvant gemcitabine for 6 months (ending in May 2013).    Patient's disease was being followed by CT scans every 6 months along with CA 19-9 levels every 3 months. On 12/23/2013, a left lung nodule was noted measuring 4mm. In November 2013, CA 19-9 was measured to be 10. Subsequently, follow-up CT thorax on 08/02/2014 showed increase in the size of the 4mm LLL pulmonary nodule to 1.1 cm. In addition, a 0.3 cm \n",
      " pulmonary nodule noted in December 2013, was noted to increase to 1.3 cm. This pulmonary nodule was spiculated and located in the left lung apex. Otherwise, there was postsurgical changes with soft tissue and stranding within the celiac artery and pancreatectomy resection beds which had increased from 11/28/2012 but unchanged from 12/23/2013. This was thought to reflect posttreatment changes. CA 19-9 level has continued to stay in the normal range.     On 08/30/2014, pulmonary lesion in the peri fissural left lower lobe was biopsied via CT guidance. During that examination, the nodule was noted to be 1.6x1.4 cm. Pathology showed adenocarcinoma, consistent with metastasis from ***** ***** (IHC positive for CK7 with patchy focal expression of *****; negative for ***** and TTF-1).     11/16/2014: completed 5000 cGy (out of 5000 cGy) to the LLL and 2500 cGy out of 2500 cGy to the ***** metastatic lesions, with *****.    02/14/15 PET/CT: New hypermetabolic 1.6 x 1.9 cm mesenteric lesion with surrounding stranding suspicious for metastasis. Interval decrease in the size and metabolic activity of the metastatic nodules in the left upper and lower lobe, reflecting response to the recently completed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy. Benign post radiation changes.   03/28/15: CT A/P showed increase in the size of the mesenteric nodule along with further increase in ***** 19-9 level. Subsequently seen by Dr. ***** ***** at ***** for consideration of *****-***** pancreatic cancer trial but was found to be ineligible due to low IGF-1 level, which was part of screening eligibility.  05/10/2015: Started Gemcitabine + Abraxane  06/27/2015: Restaging CT indicates stable disease in lungs but progression in enlarging mesenteric nodule. His CA 19-9 continued to trend down and so patient was continued on *****/Abraxane.   08/15/2015: CT indicates stable disease. Abraxane d/c due to worsening peripheral neuropathy.   11/14/15: CT scan shows stable disease. \n",

ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** ***** ***** is a 67 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patient received 4 cycles of ***** in the neoadjuvant setting and then gemcitabine in the adjuvant setting for 6 months (completed in December 2012). He then had recurrence in the lungs in 2014 for which he had *****. Most recently, he has been getting therapy with gemcitabine monotherapy (Abraxane d/c'ed in July 2015 due to neuropathy) and has stable disease on the most recent restaging scans obtained on 11/14/15. His CA 19-9 also has been declining since starting gemcitabine and *****-paclitaxel in April 2015.    At this point, he continues to be on gemcitabine monotherapy. I agree with omission of *****-paclitaxel due to the grade 2 neuropathy. Restaging scans can be obtained after 2 months of therapy (at the end of December and early January 2016) along with monthly CA 19-9 levels to monitor treatment response. If there is disease progression at that time, he can be considered for potential trials or he may be considered for 5FU \n",
      " combined with liposomal irinotecan (*****-*****). In the phase III *****-1 trial, irinotecan liposome injection in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-*****) and leucovorin demonstrated a 1.9-month improvement in overall survival (OS) with the addition of irinotecan liposome injection to 5-***** (***** et al. J Clin *****. ***** ***** 2015).  Irinotecan liposome injection dosing is at 70 mg/m2 + 5-***** at 2400 mg/m2 over 46-48 hours every 2 weeks. The most commonly reported grade ?3 adverse events (AEs) with the combination were neutropenia (20%), fatigue (14%), diarrhea (13%), vomiting (11%), nausea (8%), asthenia (8%), and abdominal pain (7%).     If he continues to have stable disease with only a few mesenteric nodule involvement for some period of time, surgical resection of these nodules may be considered (though it is not common practice). Patient understands that even if this was a possibility, it would unlikely be a curative approach but would be indicated due to his young age, indolent disease and could be considered as an opportunity to turn back the clock.     In addition, in light of the recent data regarding the potential role of immunotherapy in *****-H metastatic pancreatic cancers, I would recommend obtaining MMR via IHC or MSI status via PCR (Le D, et al. ***** 2016 Annual Meeting; ***** 195).     #Supportive care: He will continue with ***** with meals. He will continue to use gabapentin for his neuropathy. I encouraged him to maintain his weight and to remain active while undergoing therapy.    We provided the patient with information regarding our clinic hours, phone number, important details of precautions during therapy. I provided them with an opportunity to ask questions and I believe that all of their questions have been answered to their satisfaction. We encouraged him to contact us with any questions or concerns. I would be happy to see the patient back in my clinic at any point in the future.    Thank you for \n",

      "Ms. ***** is a 80 y.o. female who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of her high-grade neuroendocrine tumor of duodenal origin.     Oncologic History:   To review, the patient initially presented to the Emergency Department at UCSF Medical Center on 01/31/14 with several weeks of worsening crampy abdominal pain after intermittent epigastric pain for one year. Prior outpatient evaluation had been notable of elevated alk phos and AST/ALT. Diagnostic w/u during that UCSF admission included laboratory studies revealing an elevated bilirubin of 5.2, and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis that showed a 2.3 x 3 CM pancreatic head mass. She underwent ERCP with stent placement, leading to a resolution in her hyperbilirubinemia. Endoscopic findings included a necrotic mucosa presenting as an excavated mass beginning at the inferior angle of the duodenum, causing obstruction and obliteration of the distal bile duct. Biopsies of this lesion showed a grade 3 neuroendocrine tumor, with intermediate grade differentiation. Histologic markers were overall suggestive of a duodenal rather than pancreatic origin for this NET. Octreoscan was obtained, showing only mild uptake in the pancreatic head, and a serum chromogranin A was normal.     Ms. ***** was taken for surgical exploration and planned ***** procedure on March 14 given the absence of any metastatic disease on staging studies. Unfortunately, several liver metastases were identified intraoperatively, and surgery was therefore aborted. She underwent repeat ERCP with placement of a permanent metal metallic stent on March 16. Postoperative staging CT-PET showed a stable appearance of her pancreatic mass, and now the presence of several small hepatic lesions c/w metastases.     She is now s/p 5 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of the combination of capecitabine/temozolomide. Doses originally consisted of capecitabine 750 mg/m2 BID days November 25 \n",
      " and temozolomide 200 mg/m2 daily days August 25 of a 28 day cycle, generally well-tolerated overall. Because of progressive renal insufficiency early on during her treatment course, I dose reduced her capecitabine to 1000 mg BID x 14 days/temozolomide 200 mg days August 25 with cycle #3. Her serum creatinine subsequently normalized, and thus her chemotherapy doses were re-escalated to starting doses with her most recent cycle #4. MRI scans from early June demonstrated essentially stable disease.    On present review of systems, the patient notes:  - ***** fatigue, although trying ***** ***** active  - Mild sensitivity at incision site; otherwise, no abdominal pain  - Mild nailbed discoloration  - Eating well; no nausea or diarrhea  - No recent fevers, chills, or signs/symptoms of infection.  - Blood sugars under good control on current diabetic regimen    The remainder of the patient's review of systems was negative.

Clinically nonfunctional and grade 2 (well diff) -- oddly enough, tumor is ***** neg-- so the role of sSA is unclear-- now off all treatment. We need more scans over time-- but early indicators suggest ***** over time.    According to NCCN guidelines, the treatment recommendations for PNET depending on extent of disease, rate of growth (e.g. stable or progressing), and whether or not the patient is symptomatic (bulky disease associated with pain and/or hormone-mediated symptoms. Numerous options may be considered, including chemotherapy, targeted agents, clinical trials, ***** and liver-directed approaches (including cytoreductive surgery and hepatic arterial embolization). Unfortunately, randomized trials are generally *****, thus limiting our ability to identify the optimal sequence of treatment.    Somatostatin analogs are known to provide symptomatic improvement in hormone-mediated symptoms in 75% of patients with carcinoid symptoms. As such, use of octreotide (SQ and/or *****) is considered routine in patients with symptoms consistent with carcinoid syndrome. In addition, data suggest that octreotide also has the potential to exert a cytostatic antitumor effect. The results of the ***** study (***** et al. *****, 2009) suggest that octreotide ***** 30 mg IM q month delays time to progression in patients with well-differentiated NET arising in the midgut or unknown primary site. Lanreotide also delays progression in nonfunctional ***** (*****, *****). The optimal \n",
      " timing for intervention remains unclear (up-front at diagnosis or at the time of disease progression). As such, current NCCN guidelines suggest to consider octreotide at the time of disease progression in asymptomatic patients. In this case, the pt did not tolerate SSA and has discontinued -- may not be offering much in the setting of ***** negative disease.    Recent phase III data confirm that everolimus (4.6 vs 11 months; *****, et al. *****, 2011) and sunitinib (5.5 vs 11.4 mo; ***** et al. ***** 2011) delay progression when delivered as single agents in patients with radiologic progression. Radiographic responses are rare with either agent (e.g. <10%), but a five month improvement in time to progression was noted in both trials compared to placebo.    Treatment with systemic chemotherapy for well dif NET has yield variable results. Streptozocin-based chemotherapy was long considered standard and is FDA approved for this indication. The response rate is variable (as low as 6% in some studies),and this must be considered when weighing the relative merits and toxicity. *****, et al. reported a 39% RR in a retrospective series of patients with PNET, and this is the regimen we typically employ (***** et al., *****, 2004). *****-based treatment has activity per ***** (*****, ***** 2018)--approximately 30% RR with *****/***** and ***** alone-- but longer PFS with combination therapy (median PFS 22 mo v 14 mo with ***** alone). In this setting, chemotherapy seems like overkill given non bulky disease.    Current NCCN guidelines state that liver directed therapy may be considered in patients with liver-dominant, progressive well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Treatment (including surgical debulking, ablation, and/or hepatic arterial embolization (*****, chemoembolization, or selected internal radiation therapy) may palliate hormone-mediated symptoms and/or pain. In addition, liver-directed therapy may \n",

Left breast, mag seed-localized partial mastectomy:   1. Tumor bed with chronic inflammation.  2. Biopsy site changes.   3. Proliferative fibrocystic change with focal usual ductal hyperplasia  (*****) and sclerosing adenosis.  4. See comment.     B. Left breast, new margin, resection:   Benign breast tissue. See comment.    C. Left axillary lymph nodes, dissection:    1. Metastatic ductal carcinoma in three of twenty eight lymph nodes  (May 22).  2. Extracapsular extension.   3. Treatment effect.   4. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  5. See comment.      D. Left axillary lymph node, level 3, dissection:   1. Necrotizing lymphadenitis.  2. Two of two lymph nodes with no tumor identified (0/2).   3. See comment.    COMMENT:  The partial mastectomy specimen (part A) was extensively sampled.  Sections reveal benign breast tissue with biopsy site changes and  treatment effect. To confirm the diagnosis, immunohistochemical stains  were performed on blocks A11 and A12 at ***** with the following results:  Stain     Target     Result  Keratin     Epithelial cells     Negative for invasive carcinoma (A11  and A12)  P63     Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)  SMM   \n",
      "    Myoepithelium     Negative (A11)    The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings and rules against an occult invasive carcinoma in part A.     The immunohistochemical staining pattern supports the morphologic  findings. Positive staining for ***** along with positive MPO in  histiocytes is compatible with ***** ***** lymphadenitis. Positive  staining for T cell markers without loss of specific markers, favors a  non-neoplastic process. The CD30 stain highlights ***** and  negative staining for CD15 rules against Hodgkin lymphoma. B cell  markers are negative, ruling against a B cell lymphoma. Negative  staining for keratin and CD68 and ***** rules against a histiocytic  process or fulminant treatment effect in the lymph node. Overall, the  findings support a diagnosis of necrotizing lymphadenitis. The  differential diagnosis includes ***** ***** disease, which is  favored, as well as lymphadenitis secondary to systemic lupus  erythematous. Serologic testing for lupus to rule out the diagnosis is  recommended.     ***** ***** is a self-limiting auto-immune disorder which presents  as acute or sub-acute lymphadenitis over the course of several weeks.  The differential diagnosis includes T cell lymphoma, which is largely  excluded in this case by IHC staining as well as lupus which can have  similar ***** (ref 1).

      "Mr. ***** is a 37 y.o. male who comes to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in consultation for his metastatic pancreatic cancer. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all his outside records.    History of Present Illness  This gentleman first developed nausea/vomiting, waxing/waning, beginning in November 2014, but progressively worsening over time. Labs drawn by his PCP demonstrated an elevated lipase, prompting his presentation to his local ED on 01/06/2015 for further w/u of presumed pancreatitis. Abdominal U/S showed multiple liver masses consistent with malignancy. Subsequent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a 6 cm irregular mass in the body of the pancreas with encasement of the hepatic and splenic arteries and invasion of the third portion of the duodenum with obstruction, and multiple hepatic metastases. CT-PET confirmed a pancreatic body primary tumor infiltrating into the left adrenal fossa and to the third portion of the duodenum: 6 x 4.6 x 5.2 cm/SUV 5.1; extensive, confluent liver metastases; numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules; at least 3 hypermetabolic skeletal metastases (sacrum, mid T5 vertebral body); small volume ascites; omental nodularity and peritoneal thickening; and numerous mesenteric lymph nodes. Spine MRI showed focal signal abnormality in the S1 vertebral body, and areas of disc protrusion at T12-L1 and L3-4.    During the patient's hospital admission, he was maintained on a liquid diet and rx'ed with anti-emetics. Liver biopsy was performed on 01/08/2015, which apparently showed metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of pancreatic or biliary origin (formal report N/A).    The patient's present review of systems was reviewed and notable for the following:  - PO intake modest, including soups and some solids. No/minimal postprandial vomiting; nausea under reasonable control on anti-emetics  - \n",

I agree with findings demonstrating a large pancreatic body mass with vascular encasement, with multiple hepatic metastases, small pulmonary nodules, and omental/peritoneal nodularity.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 37 y.o. male with newly diagnosed, extensive metastatic pancreatic cancer. He is still in decent shape with an ECOG PS of 0. We discussed the following at today's visit:    The mainstay of treatment at this point should consist of systemic therapy, that \n",
      " the goals of such treatment treatment are to produce disease control and hopefully extend survival, while possibly alleviating cancer-related symptoms, but would not be expected to achieve cure.    There are several possible chemotherapy options for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of therapy depending on the patient's age, performance status, co-morbid conditions, and personal preference. The two current gold standards for front-line treatment, based on phase III data, include:    - ***** (biweekly ***** 5-*****, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin), which was shown in a phase III French cooperative group trial to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in terms of overall survival, PFS, *****, and other clinical outcomes. Side effects of this regimen were discussed, including but not limited to immunosuppression, risk of infection, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. I explained that this regimen requires placement of a Mediport due to the ***** component of therapy (48 hour infusion of 5-*****). Furthermore, because of the high incidence of grade _ neutropenia with this regimen, we tend to give primary prophylaxis with growth factor support (***** or Neupogen) after each treatment cycle.  - The combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, which was shown in a phase III international trial (*****) also to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Side effects and logistics of this regimen were also explained.  - For patients too frail or with medical co-morbidities that may preclude the administration of combination chemotherapy, gemcitabine monotherapy represents an appropriate choice.    Certainly clinical trials also represent an ideal option. We discussed with the patient in detail about two study possibilities we have available here at ***** for \n",
      " the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer, and he was sent consent forms for both of these ahead of time to review:  (1) the ***** trial, a randomized phase II trial evaluating the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel with or without *****-*****, a bispecific monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R and *****. For this study, patients are initially screened by measurement of serum free IGF-1 levels, as only those with high IGF-1 levels are randomized. The study also requires tumor tissue for assessment of intratumoral Heregulin (HRG) expression, although there is no cutoff for study eligibility. ***** the nature of clinical trial and specifically the study rationale, treatment regimen, screening tests and logistics of the above clinical trial.   (2) a phase II trial consisting of the combination of gemcitabine/*****-paclitaxel plus ibrutinib.    After much discussion and consideration, the patient is inclined to move ahead with SOC chemotherapy with *****. He is in fact already scheduled to have a Mediport placed through his local oncologist tomorrow, and will let us know w/i the next day or so whether he wishes to receive his treatment locally vs here at *****.    The other issues we covered included:  - Pain management: A new script for ***** ***** was provided for long-acting RTC pain control. Future consideration could be made for EUS-guided celiac plexus nerve block as well if he does not respond adequate to opioid analgesics.  - Given his young age at presentation, I will make a referral for him to be seen at our Cancer Risk program for genetic counseling, despite the absence of a family history of cancer.  - The patient does have some pain referrable to the sacrum, with PET and MRI suggesting some osseous metastases in that area. For now, I will see how this responds to systemic therapy, but we could consider spot RT to that area in the future.    All of the patient's questions \n",
      " were answered to his and his partner's satisfaction. If he chooses to receive his care at ***** we will get him set up to start within the next week or so.  \n",

Patient Identification and Oncology History  ***** *****-***** is a 58 y.o. female with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She presented to a local emergency department on 04/10/2019 with 2 weeks of excessive fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Laboratory evaluation at that time demonstrated elevated liver enzymes with Tbili of 6.6. This prompted a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed 1.8 cm hypodense mass within the pancreatic head, with evidence of intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. She underwent an ERCP on 04/11/19 with placement of plastic stent. Biopsy of the ampullary mucosa was negative for any evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. She then had a repeat CT of the A/P with pancreatic protocol on 04/15/19 which demonstrated a 2.1 x 3.0 x 2.8 cm mass in the uncinate process extending to the ampulla and head.     She was eventually referred to ***** (Dr. *****) and underwent and EUS/ERCP on 04/26/2019 which measured the mass at 3.5 x2.0 cm in the head head/uncinate process of pancreas. FNA from this demonstrated malignant cells consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, NOS. She was reportedly referred to an oncologist and planned to have port placement for initiation of chemotherapy this upcoming week. However, she presented to UCSF emergency room on May 16 for evaluation of anxiety related to her diagnosis.

A CT chest angio was obtained on 10/26/15, which was negative for PE but noted 2 liver lesions along with pancreatic tail mass measuring 5.8x3.9x3.5 cm. Patient reports back pain starting in 09/03/15.  During that hospitalization, patient was noted to have LFT abnormalities and was evaluated by Dr. *****.    On 12/02/15, MRI abdomen was obtained which revealed a pancreatic tail mass measuring 6.2x6.1x5.1 cm. 4 hepatic lesions of largest measuring 2.7x2.1x2.1cm in the left lobe of the liver and 3x2.7x3.1 cm in the right lobe of the liver were also noted. These were concerning for metastatic disease.    An EUS was performed on 12/12/15 which revealed a pancreatic tail mass measuring 3x2.8 cm with liver metastases and some small peripancreatic nodes. The mass was noted to ***** the splenic artery without clear invasion. EUS staging was T3. Biopsy of the pancreatic mass revealed adenocarcinoma. Biopsy of the liver lesions was not performed. Of note, he had an \n",
      " EGD/colonoscopy one year previously and only gastritis was noted.     He states that he lost approximately 34 lbs since November. He has been drinking Ensure for nutritional support. He is experiencing fatigue but he still tries to stay active. He has difficulty falling asleep but reports taking naps during daytime. He notes constipation over the past year.

There is geographic regions   of differing signal within the liver suggestive of a fatty liver.    There are 4 hepatic lesions again identified. One is noted in the   left lobe of the liver measuring 2.7 x 2.1 x 2.1 cm. There is   adjacent small 8mm Satellite lesion. Another lesion by the ***** of   the right lobe of the liver measures 3.0 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm. These   demonstrate \n",
      " increased T2 signal and demonstrate early peripheral   nodular enhancement. The third lesion is in the right lobe of the   liver on image 27, series 903 and measures 1.0 x 0.8 cm. These do not   demonstrate significant fill-in on the delayed 20 minute images. They   are not isointense to liver on the delayed hepatocyte phase.    There is a heterogeneous lesion involving the tail of the pancreas.   The proximal portion measures 3.4 x 3.2 cm and demonstrates   *****. The distal portion is more cystic measuring 4.6 x   2.7 cm. There is adjacent dilatation. There is peripheral enhancement   of the cystic component.     CONCLUSION:  Large heterogeneous mass involving the tail of the pancreas which   measures approximately 6.2 x 6.1 x 5.1 cm. This is highly suspicious   for pancreatic carcinoma.    There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no intra-or   extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.    There are at least 4 hepatic lesions which likely represent   metastases.    ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** is a 57 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He saw Dr. ***** in clinic today as well. He has 4 hepatic lesions which are concerning for metastatic disease. We will arrange for biopsy of the hepatic lesions, to get pathologic confirmation that he has metastatic disease. If there is pathologic confirmation of metastatic disease, we will consider him for one of our clinical trials vs systemic chemotherapy (***** vs gemcitabine and *****-paclitaxel).     I reviewed that in the setting of metastatic pancreatic cancer, cure will be unlikely but that our efforts will be focused on making his disease into a chronic disease while preserving quality of life.  I informed them that treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer involves systemic therapy. Systemic therapy can include \n",
      " chemotherapy, targeted therapies or immunotherapy. In general, if there are clinical trials available, we also strongly recommend consideration of a clinical trial participation. The standard chemotherapeutic options include modified-*****, gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel, or single-agent gemcitabine.     During today's visit, I also reviewed the our clinical trials for front-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. We currently have two trials:  1) \"*****#***** ***** Randomized, *****-*****, *****-Controlled Phase ***** ***** ***** *****-***** plus *****-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine versus *****-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in *****-Line Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer (*****)\" in which patients with high IGF-1 serum levels are randomized to receive gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel or to receive gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel plus *****-*****, which is a tetravalent bispecific antibody antagonist of IGF-IR and *****.    2) \"*****#***** ***** Phase Ib/II Safety and Efficacy Trial of Ibrutinib Combined with Gemcitabine and *****-Paclitaxel in ***** with Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma\" in which patient with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma receive gemcitabine combined with *****-paclitaxel plus Ibrutinib, which is a *****'s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK) that prevents B-cell activation and B-cell mediated signaling.    My recommendation would be consideration of the ***** trial to determine if the patient has high serum levels of IGF-1. If he is found to have low serum levels of IGF-1, I would recommend proceeding with consideration of the latter trial studying the role of Ibrutinib.      If the patient agrees to proceed with standard chemotherapy, we will monitor treatment response with monthly CA 19-9 levels and restaging CT scans every 2 months. He will need baseline CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with contrast prior to initiation of chemotherapy. We will also obtain baseline labs including CBC with \n",
      " diff, LFTs, chemistry panel and CA 19-9 prior to his first cycle of chemotherapy.     As the patient has a strong family history of cancer and due to his young age at diagnosis, we will request assistance from our genetic counselors for evaluation of a possible hereditary pancreatic cancer syndromes. We have placed a referral to our Cancer Center dietician for weight maintenance. We will provide a prescription of antiemetics and anti-diarrheal medications prior to the initiation of the chemotherapy. I provided handouts on chemotherapy regimen details and provided him with an opportunity to ask questions. I believe that I was able to answer all of his questions to his satisfaction.     He will return to ***** ***** in clinic after the pathology from the biopsy is available.     #Hyperbilirubinemia: T. Bili 1.9 on prior labs; we will get labs prior to next visit to make sure that there is not further increase in bilirubin. If there is worsening hyperbilirubinemia, we will have to obtain imaging to evaluate for biliary ***** and potential ERCP for consideration of stent placement.    #HTN: Not well-controlled today. He didn't take lisinopril this morning.  -I recommended that the patient take the lisinopril today and daily as prescribed by his PCP.    We provided the patient with information regarding our clinic hours, phone number, important details of precautions during therapy. I provided them with an opportunity to ask questions and I believe that all of their questions have been answered to their satisfaction. We encouraged him to contact us with any questions or concerns. I would be happy to see the patient back in my clinic at any point in the future.    Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the care of this kind patient. Please feel free to call me at any time at *****-*****-***** if you have any questions about the treatment, my recommendations, or if I can be of any assistance in the \n",

      "Thank you for referring Ms. ***** ***** ***** to the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center  for evaluation of her pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  I saw ***** ***** ***** ***** ***** Oncology  practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in ***** ***** *****. ***** *****.    History of Present Illness  Ms. ***** is a 69 y.o. female who initially presented with jaundice in August 2011, at which time an ERCP with placement of biliary stent was performed for what presumably was a malignant biliary stricture. This was complicated by some post-procedure pancreatitis. Repeat ERCP with EUS at ***** apparently confirmed a mass in the head of the pancreas, which was biopsied and revealed adenocarcinoma (original report N/A). She underwent a ***** procedure on 10/01/11 at Chinese Hospital, with pathology revealing moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma measuring at least 2 cm with no lymph node involvement (0/21 lymph nodes). The tumor was noted to invade muscularis propria of duodenum extending into bile duct margin.    The patient was started on adjuvant gemcitabine starting on 01/05/12, originally dosed as weekly for 3 weeks for the first cycle, followed thereafter by once a month dosing for 6 cycles under the care of Dr. ***** *****. CT abdomen/pelvis obtained on 08/31/12 revealed a 1.7cm cystic structure in the pancreatic body and a new 1.5 soft tissue density posterior to the proximal SMA with partial encasement. In addition there was an ill-defined sclerotic density within the L2 vertebral body. Subsequent PET/CT was obtained which showed dilatation of the pancreatic duct in the body and tail with a cystic area proximal to it, suggesting possible recurrence. There was also increased FDG activity in the L2 vertebral body (SUV 4.9) which corresponded to the sclerotic lesion concerning for metastasis, as well as the 1.5x1.4 cm soft tissue nodular lesion in the left paraaortic region also concerning for metastatic lymphadenopathy.     Patient \n",
      " continued to receive gemcitabine administered q3 weeks, but her CA 19-9 continued to increase (38 (July 2012) to 179 (October 2012) to 328 (November 2012) to 700 (January 2013). Her last dose of gemcitabine was at the end of December 2012. She states that after the last cycle of chemotherapy, it took her awhile to recover in terms of fatigue and dizziness. However, currently her energy level is good and she has been working out, practicing ***** ***** to keep active. Her appetite is only fair and she does not tolerate meat and fish. She uses ***** 2 capsules with meals and 1 capsule with snacks. She has been losing weight to a total of 6 lbs over past 6 months. She has nausea but no vomiting.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** ***** is a 69 y.o. female who presents to our GI Oncology  practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for evaluation of her recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Following her original ***** operation, she received adjuvant gemcitabine, mostly dosed in a somewhat unusual fashion of once-monthly. She now has evidence of recurrent disease based on suspicious radiographic findings (local recurrence plus presumed metastatic disease to the lymph nodes and L2 vertebral body) and a rising *****-9 biomarker. Apparently the patient had a repeat PET/CT obtained last week, while off treatment for the past month-plus, although we currently do not have the report or the images available for review. We will work on obtaining these as well as getting a full set of laboratory studies during patient's visit today.     Her ***** off-treatment is reasonably good, and depending on the extent and progression of her disease we will decide on the need and timing of re-initiating chemotherapy. The patient understands that such treatment would be for prolongation of life (but not cure) and possibly symptom palliation. As the patient has concerns about chemotherapy and the side effects related to systemic therapy, our recommendation would be try treatment with ***** or ***** and see how well she tolerates it. We reviewed some of the potential side effects including but not limited to : bone marrow suppression increasing the risk of infections, bleeding and transfusions, nausea,vomiting, diarrhea, cold sensitivity,mucositis, neuropathy, and hand-foot syndrome. We provided the patient and his daughter to ask \n",
      " questions via a Cantonese interpreter and we believe that all of their questions were answered to their satisfaction.    In the meantime, we have placed a referral to the Cancer Center nutritionist for recommendations regarding dietary intake. In addition, we have asked the patient to have her PICC line removed ***** and will instead arrange for the patient to have a chest port placement for venous access. She will follow-up with us again in one week to discuss details regarding treatment options.     Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient.

Relevant Diagnostic Studies:    Most recent labs notable for the following:    09/23/2015:  WBC 5.5, Hct 40.1, platelets 189  Creat 1.38  AST/ALT *****/*****, alk phos 133, tot bili 0.5  *****-9 35    I personally reviewed and interpreted the patient's relevant imaging studies in conjunction with the corresponding formal radiology report, as detailed above in *****. I agree with findings demonstrating a primary pancreatic head mass, as \n",
      " well as extensive multifocal hepatic metastases.        Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 42 y.o. male with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer. I explained to the patient and his family why the mainstay of treatment at this point should consist of systemic therapy rather than surgery or radiation, and that the goals of such treatment treatment are to produce disease control/remission and hopefully extend survival, while possibly alleviating cancer-related symptoms, but that it is not curative in intent.    There are several possible SOC chemotherapy options for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of therapy depending on the patient's age, performance status, co-morbid conditions, and personal preference. The two current gold standards for front-line treatment (for patients who are well enough to receive combination chemotherapy), based on phase III data, include:    - ***** (biweekly ***** 5-*****, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin), which was shown in a phase III French cooperative group trial to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer in terms of overall survival, PFS, *****, and other clinical outcomes. Side effects of this regimen were discussed, including but not limited to immunosuppression, risk of infection, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. I explained that this regimen requires placement of a Mediport due to the ***** component of therapy (48 hour infusion of 5-*****). Furthermore, because of the high incidence of grade _ neutropenia with this regimen, we tend to give primary prophylaxis with growth factor support (***** or Neupogen) after each treatment cycle.    - The combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel, which was shown in a phase III international trial (*****) also to be superior to gemcitabine monotherapy for patients with metastatic \n",
      " pancreatic cancer. Side effects and logistics of this regimen were also explained.    If Mr. ***** wishes to proceed with SOC chemotherapy, I would go the route of *****, and will try to help coordinate his port placement and initiation of treatment closer to home ASAP.    Certainly clinical trials also represent an ideal option; we have two first-line trials here at ***** for which he may be eligible:    - The ***** trial, a randomized phase II trial evaluating the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel with or without *****-*****, a bispecific monoclonal antibody directed against IGF-1R and *****. For this study, patients are initially screened by measurement of serum free IGF-1 levels, as only those with high IGF-1 levels are eligible. The patient was provided a consent form ahead of time to review and has a clear understanding of the experimental nature of this clinical trial and the essential logistics of the study. He went ahead and signed consent today, so we may proceed with initial screening and see if he qualifies.    - We also have a second separate 1st-line trial evaluating the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel plus the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, which he could consider if he does not qualify for the *****-***** trial by serum IGF-1 level.    As the patient's wife was also very interested in learning about clinical trials using ***** as a chemotherapy backbone, I furthermore directed them to the ***** 1313 randomized phase II trial of ***** +/- the recombination hyaluronidase enzyme ***** that is ongoing in ***** and USC, although the logistics of travel and scheduling may make this prohibitive. Specifically, I do think it is imperative for Mr. ***** to get started on treatment sooner rather than later given his symptoms and burden of disease, so we will hopefully be able to move forward with one of the above options over the course of the next 1-2 weeks.    In the meantime, \n",
      " I will also refer him to our Cancer Risk program to meet with one of our genetic counselors, given his young age at presentation and (+)FHx of breast cancer. I provided a new prescription for Zofran to use for nausea; and counseled him and his family on symptoms to watch for, including the potential for developing obstructive jaundice symptoms.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his and his family's satisfaction over the course of their 80-minute visit, the majority counseling him about his cancer diagnosis and the above treatment options.    \n",

      "ATTENDING: ***** *****, MD     This is an independent visit    SUBJECTIVE:  This is a very pleasant 63 y.o. retired grade ***** from ***** with a diagnosis of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.    She presented in July 2018 with recurrent abdominal pain and loss of appetite as well as a 10 pound weight loss in one month. She was found to have diabetes. On 08/05/2018 CT scan was done which showed a mass in the pancreatic body and tail with indeterminate liver lesions. An EUS guided fine needle aspiration of the pancreas revealed adenocarcinoma.    Patient had initial consultation with Dr. ***** on 09/14/18 and she was recommended to undergo repeat imaging to determine the extent of her disease. Because patient may also have an inherited susceptibility to cancer we wanted to wait until we had a read out on her mutation status for DNA repair mutations. This has resulted and is negative to date.    09/23/18: Pancreas protocol CT reported an infiltrative mass in the distal pancreas results in near occlusion of the splenic artery and veins. Tumor interfaces along 180 degrees circumference of the ***** trunk and less than 180 degree of the common hepatic artery. Narrowing of the ***** venous confluence and upper SMV suggests involvement. Mass abuts the celiac celiac ganglion    09/23/18: MRI of the liver revealed  several hepatic hemangiomata and punctate simple cysts. Geographic regions of noncontrast retention on hepatobiliary phase, which are noncharacteristic for metastases.    10/11/18: Patient presented for consideration of C1D1 *****/Abraxane, however, given her symptoms, there was concern for gastric outlet obstruction and so treatment was held and she was advised to go to the *****.     *****/*****/***** - *****/*****/*****: Admitted for possible GI obstruction.

On 10/12/18, patient underwent ERCP in an attempt to place a duodenal stent. However, the Hepatobiliary Service was unable to traverse the high grade obstruction with wire under fluoroscopic guidance.  On 10/13/18, a RUE PICC line was placed for upcoming chemotherapy and TPN, and on 10/14/18, patient underwent placement of a J-tube and a venting G-tube. On 10/18/18 she started C1D1 neoadjuvant gemcitabine/Abraxane. A CT chest on 10/22/18 revealed a linear filling defect noted within the right brachycephalic artery, likely sequela of a catheter associated thrombus. Again noted is occlusion of the right subclavian vein.

      " w/*****-***** *****, developed in the context of underlying cystic fibrosis, IDDM, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.After taking into consideration her significant medical co-morbidities ***** weighing the risks/benefits of therapy, we opted to proceed ***** chemotherapy with a ***** regimen. She is now s/p 4 treatment cycles (with a dose reduction of irinotecan beginning cycle #2), with her first 2 cycles c/b a hospital admission due to exacerbation of her CF and accompanying infectious complications.    Issues addressed at today's visit:    - Metastatic pancreatic cancer. We reviewed her most recent imaging studies which demonstrate findings concerning for a new liver metastasis, consistent with her rising *****-9 levels. I would like to biopsy the dominant liver lesion to confirm this diagnosis, but would recommend at this point holding current chemotherapy for the time being. We talked about likely needing to pivot to a gemcitabine-based regimen, of which I will try the combination of gemcitabine plus *****-paclitaxel on a ***** dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle). I explained to her the logistics, scheduling, and some of the potential side effects of this new regimen including but not limited to nausea/vomiting, alopecia, fatigue, cytopenias with resultant immunosuppression and/or anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy.     Unfortunately with her infectious complication risk and CF diagnosis, she does not currently represent an appropriate candidate for therapeutic cancer clinical trials.    - Infectious disease. ***** continue to coordinate care with colleagues from ***** and Pulmonary services, with strategy of prophylactic minocycline 100mg PO BID on days November 29 of each chemo cycle (during her expected count nadir) for MSSA suppression. Given sputum culture results and moderate exacerbation of respiratory symptoms prior to her last treatment cycle, \n",
      " she was treated more aggressively with PO levofloxacin + IV cefazolin (anticipated through 12/14/2020).    Additionally, for aspergillus surveillance, she will also have q2 weekly blood draws for galactomannan, and CT scans of the chest q2 monthly (which we can align with her tumor response assessments).    - Cystic fibrosis. Transferred CF care to Pulmonary Medicine clinic at *****. In addition to continuing consistent pulmonary toileting at home for underlying CF, maintained on Symbicort --> Advair, *****, hypertonic saline, and 3x/weekly azithromycin. Appears ***** stable at today's video visit.    - Molecular testing (Foundation One) revealed APC and ***** (*****) mutations; microsatellite stability and TMB could not be assessed. None of these are specifically actionable at the present time. Germline testing to assess for any hereditary predisposition to cancer showed pathogenic mutations in ***** and CFTR.    - Symptom management/supportive care. Referred to our Cancer Center psycho-oncology program to help with coping mechanisms. Also seen at our our Symptom Management Service. For pain management: continues with long-acting morphine which is providing good pain control.      Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities.    \n",

Date of Service: 04/30/18    Interim History:  - The patient was last seen in clinic on 04/02/18. She reports feeling better and being able to move more.    - She called in last week with concern because her incision macerated. She is continuing to have breast pain and soreness though it is improving.    - She started PT. She states that it was painful initially, but she does practice the exercises 3 x day. Her goal is to have pre-op range of motion. She has also increased her walking.    - Since starting letrozole, she notices more joint pain on feet (prior on knees only) mostly in the morning. In the beginning it was difficult to walk but she is adjusting.    - She also notes nausea in the afternoon that might have been caused by oxycodone. She is still taking oxycodone a day and her goal is to wean off it soon.     - She notes some hair thinning since starting treatment.    - She has numbness on her right foot toe pads (#***** ***** #*****). She has *****/needles on the rest of the right foot and left foot.    - She continues to have hot flashes, but adjusts to it by varying how much clothes she wears at night.  She has an appointment for her first acupuncture session.     - She is weaning Ativan and using it only when needed and ***** by increasing melatonin (20mg).and trazodone (50mg).    - She is thinking about returning to work. She was a charge nurse and worked nights on a general surgery floor. From a financial point she needs to work and she wants to return. She is looking to transition to the clinic setting.    - She is finding support in a FB group but describes it as a \"*****-hate\" because exposure to other stories causes some worry.    - See below for additional review of systems.

Right Breast cancer: ***** is currently without evidence of recurrence either locally or systemically based on physical exam findings or review of symptoms. She has been seen in the Survivorship clinic  and was advised to stop Tamoxifen and switch to letrozole. However, there was no symptom improvement on letrozole so she was recently advised to switch to Exemestane. She was not aware of this recommendation. I again recommended discontinuing Letrozole and waiting 2-3 weeks before starting Exemestane to see if she tolerates it better. She understands that we still recommend at least 5 years of hormonal therapy and \n",
      " despite her side effects, she does have intentions of continuing hormone therapy for 5 years.    She is due for her right mammogram in July. Continue mammograms alternating with MRI  and every 6 month clinical breast exam.    2. Depression: She is currently on Pristiq 75 mg. I discussed with her the value of Duloxetine for ***** induced joint pain but I am concerned about the drug interaction of these two medications.

We had a lengthy discussion with the patient in which we reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. We \n",
      " reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports.     We discussed the use of locoregional therapies to reduce risk of locoregional disease and the use of systemic therapies to primarily reduce risk of systemic recurrence, which can potentially be incurable.     Because she has HR+ disease, she will need at least 5 years of hormonal therapy. Data from *****/TEXT trial demonstrated that patient who were premenopausal at their breast cancer diagnosis and recovered ovarian function after completion of chemotherapy, the combination of ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor was superior to tamoxifen in terms of preventing distant recurrence. However, given the low grade and low proliferation rate of her tumor, we do not believe she will benefit chemotherapy. We discussed that molecular tests such as ***** can be helpful for situations where the decision regarding chemotherapy may not be as clear. She is interested in her ***** score and we will order. In the meantime she can proceed with radiation consult and sim, not to start xrt until after ***** result comes back.    Given she is pre-menopausal, and has a low grade/low proliferation tumor, we would recommend she start with tamoxifen after completion of adjuvant radiation. If her ***** test is in the higher end of intermediate we can discuss the potential benefit of *****/*****, otherwise tamoxifen will likely be sufficient.     We discussed the importance of exercise - at least 150min of aerobic exercises per week, weight bearing exercises at least 2x a week, and to reduce alcohol and sugar/***** intake.

      "VIDEO VISIT  I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.      Mr. ***** is a 61 y.o. male whom I am seeing as a video visit at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.    History of Present Illness, reviewed:  This pleasant gentleman initially presented to medical attention in December 2019 with urinary urge incontinence (urinalysis negative), with associated suprapubic discomfort. He also endorsed weight loss of 10 pounds since June, ***** with the beginning of the *****-19 pandemic, but otherwise no fever or infectious symptoms. Ultimately, as his symptoms progressed, he underwent a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis (01/24/20) that demonstrated a 3.5 cm pancreatic tail mass with occlusion of the splenic vein and encasement of the splenic artery with resultant upper abdominal collaterals. Possible abutment of the mass on the stomach and left adrenal gland was seen. Additionally, there was multifocal hepatic metastatic disease with resultant mild right intrahepatic biliary dilatation, as well as diffuse circumferential rectosigmoid wall thickening, possibly representing proctitis for which he received a 2 week course of Septra -> ciprofloxacin which provided mild pain relief. Laboratory studies (02/09/2020) showed his liver enzymes to be moderately elevated, with ALT 114 and AST 71, and his CA 19-9 to be markedly abnormal at 19,362 U/mL.    He eventually underwent a CT guided liver biopsy on 02/29/20, and pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma of pancreatobiliary origin. He also subsequently was found to have cytologically-confirmed peritoneal carcinomatosis, \n",
      " with (+) metastatic adenocarcinoma in his ascitic fluid (paracentesis 06/07/2020).    He initiated chemotherapy with ***** on 03/20/2020 and received a total of 6 cycles through 06/05/2020, requiring dose reductions (irinotecan 90 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 68 mg/m2) by the end. His disease course has been notable for recurrent large bowel obstruction, initially treated with colonic stent placement back in April; then, with recurrent symptoms last month, requiring a prolonged hospital admission at ***** campus from June 14 - 07/19/2020. He was managed symptomatically with NGT decompression, octreotide, dexamethasone, and pain management, with the obstruction gradually resolving. He was also rx'ed for an MSSA bacteremia with a 4-week course of IV antibiotics. We had a GOC discussion while he was in the hospital, at which time he expressed a desire to remain proactive with further rx if at all possible.    Review of systems  Since discharge from the hospital, Mr. ***** reports:  - Home VNA services once weekly, plus sister is now living with him at his home. Patient himself does require fairly regular assistance with most ADLs and with ambulation.  - Pain management consists of Fentanyl patch plus Dilaudid for breakthrough; fair control (better at night than during the daytime).  - Tolerating some solid POs, with occasional postprandial nausea/vomiting.  - (+) passing flatus and semi-solid BMs  - No recent fevers     Current Outpatient Medications   Medication Instructions   \u0007 acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 1,000 mg, Oral, Every 8 Hours   \u0007 apixaban (ELIQUIS) 5 mg, Oral, 2 Times Daily Scheduled   \u0007 bisacodyL (DULCOLAX) 10 mg, Rectal, Daily PRN   \u0007 dexAMETHasone (DECADRON) 4 mg, Oral, 2 times daily   \u0007 [START ***** 08/17/2020] fentaNYL (DURAGESIC) 12 mcg/hr patch 1 patch, Transdermal, Every 72 Hours   \u0007 HYDROmorphone (DILAUDID) 2-4 mg, Oral, Every 3 Hours PRN   \u0007 LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg, Oral, Daily PRN   \u0007 metoclopramide HCl (REGLAN) \n",

Spleen: Overall similar appearance of ill-defined ***** splenic lesions (series 3 image 33, 43). Pancreas:  Similar ill-defined pancreatic tail mass as described in the index lesions. Adrenal Glands:  Similar abutment of the pancreatic mass to the left adrenal gland. Kidneys:  Unremarkable GI Tract:  Nasogastric tube along the gastric body. Improving mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel wall edema throughout the colon with residual thickening seen at the sigmoid colon. No evidence for bowel obstruction. Similar outpouching along the gastric antrum with associated wall thickening which may represent a gastric ulceration. Vasculature:  Moderate atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and its branches. Chronically occluded splenic vein with perisplenic and perigastric varices.

Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 61 y.o. male with metastatic pancreatic cancer, s/p front-line rx with ***** x 6 cycles but with evidence of \n",
      " radiographic/clinical disease progression including recurrent bowel obstruction as detailed above. He has just recently been d/c'ed from the hospital following a prolonged admission for obstruction, pain, and bacteremia.    We again had a GOC discussion, as I expressed concerns re: the risk:benefit ratio of any further salvage treatment and why he may instead wish to refocus his goals on purely palliative/symptomatic measures with a transition to hospice, given that his expected longevity is likely measurable in weeks to a few months at best (if he chooses this path, he indicated a desire for an inpatient facility rather than home hospice). He understands why the mainstay of any treatment at this point would center on systemic therapy (i.e. a gemcitabine-based regimen -- in case, no more than gemcitabine monotherapy), and we talked about potential side fx and risks, esp in terms of infectious complications, and adverse impact on his *****.    Of note, molecular profiling results of his tumor show mutations in *****, *****, *****, SMAD4, and ATR; as well as microsatellite stability. Regardless, in his overall condition and w/his recurrent bowel obstruction, I do not think he would be an appropriate clinical trial candidate for any of our early phase studies.    Symptom-wise, he is followed by our Cancer Center Symptom Management Service; his pain appears reasonably managed right now with a combination of long- and short acting opioid analgesics. He does not appear to be frankly obstructed.     Mr. ***** will take some time to decide whether he wishes to pursue further salvage rx vs a purely palliative route, and will let us know once he comes to a final decision.        Medical decision-making:  Problems: The patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring \n",

      "Mr. ***** is a 79 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his resected pancreatic cancer, s/p pyloric-sparing ***** pancreatectomy performed at ***** on 02/04/2012. A portal vein reconstruction was required as part of the operation. The pathologic specimen from his surgical procedure was interpreted as a 2.2 cm well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with extension into the peri-pancreatic soft tissue and perineural invasion. Tumor was present 1 mm from the posterior surgical margin. February 27 lymph nodes were involved with adenocarcinoma.     Following recovery postoperatively, he proceeded to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with single-agent gemcitabine x a total of 6 cycles (3 weeks on, 1 week off) at a dose of 800 mg/m2 (dose-reduced after first cycle 2o to cytopenias). Therapy was completed in mid-August.     On present review of systems, the patient notes:  - Soft daily BMs  - Mild olfactory changes  - Mild residual incisional pain  - No recent fevers  - No SOB, cough  - Reasonably good appetite. He does use ***** with meals.  - Regular activity (walks daily).  - Blood sugars under better control, on current standing plus sliding-scale insulin regimen.

However, he does have some radiographic findings on ***** ***** *****-PET concerning for possibly pulmonary metastases (the hypermetabolic activity along the CBD is less specific, and not a typical pattern of disease recurrence). For now, I would not immediately embark on resuming treatment, but closely monitor these findings with a repeat scan again in mid-February. In the best case scenario, lung-only metastases can follow a very indolent course and not require treatment for a number of months or even a year or more. At the point of needing to consider systemic therapy, accounting for the patient's age and mild CRI, we could think about capecitabine (+/- oxaliplatin), or possibly gemcitabine in conjunction with *****-paclitaxel.    All of the above considerations were explained to the patient and his daughter, who understand and are in agreement. F/u will be arranged with me again in mid- to late- February.          \n",

Following intravenous administration of 6.8 mCi of F18-FDG, a nondiagnostic, low dose CT was performed for localization and attenuation correction purposes. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 55 minutes after FDG injection. PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data. PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted. Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images.

Left breast cancer: I had a lengthy discussion with the patient and her daughter in which I reviewed her breast cancer diagnosis, workup and treatment history to date. I reviewed all of the relevant and available clinic notes, imaging, and pathology reports. Today, we discussed her pathology report which demonstrates a number of favorable characteristics including high ER positivity and relatively small size of resected tumor. However, there are a number of findings including  *****-67 of 20%, lack of expression of PR, and increase in grade from the core biopsy from grade 1 to grade 2 on the surgical specimen which creates some concern that  this cancer may be more high-risk. I recommended she begin endocrine therapy for a minimum of 5 years or longer, but we will plan to get an ***** to evaluate the potential benefit of chemotherapy.     In terms of hormonal therapy, I explained that aromatase inhibitors have been shown to have improved outcomes in terms of DFS as compared to tamoxifen. I also discussed the data from *****, *****, and ***** ***** which demonstrated modest benefit of extending hormonal therapy beyond 5 years. I explained that the decision to continue the aromatase inhibitor beyond 5 years should be an individualized decision based on the patient's risk and tolerance of hormonal therapy.    I reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with an aromatase inhibitors including arthralgias, urogenital atrophy, and possible acceleration of bone density loss. I explained that the joint pains are often the most difficult side effect to manage, and not infrequently, patients will switch to another aromatase inhibitor.    Plan  - Instructed patient to begin letrozole, prescription ordered.  - Ordered ***** to evaluate potential benefit of chemotherapy.

First, we reviewed her pathology which showed 2.2cm grade 2 IDC ER+/PR+/*****-, February 27 *****. We explained that this is a highly curable cancer and we hope to reduce the risk of recurrence with adjuvant therapies.    For locoregional therapy, she already underwent right breast lumpectomy with IORT. Given her positive LN, she is scheduled for adjuvant radiation therapy with Dr. *****.     For systemic control and prevention of future breast cancer recurrence, we discussed the importance of endocrine therapy at length. ***** thinks that she is post-menopausal but we will get an estradiol now to check, and then repeat again on treatment in 3-6 months. Assuming her estradiol is negative, we will start an aromatase inhibitor and prescribed exemestane today. We prefer an aromatase inhibitor over tamoxifen in her case given that is stabilized on duloxetine which ***** with tamoxifen, she already has fatty liver disease with slightly elevated LFTs, and her clot risk may be higher due to her relative immobility. We reviewed the anticipated side effects and risks associated with aromatase inhibitors including but not limited to arthralgias, increased risk of bone thinning/osteoporosis, urogenital symptoms, hot flashes, fatigue, hair thinning, vaginal dryness, and mood lability. We discussed that she has baseline joint pain due to her fibromyalgia, so we will monitor this closely. She is already on duloxetine which has been shown to help, and is on celebrex as well. We recommend NSAIDs for joint pain \n",
      " if needed.     In terms of deciding whether she would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, we discussed the value of ***** score in making this decision.Given her low ***** score of 5, we do not recommend chemotherapy in her case.     Recommendations:  # Breast cancer  -- Baseline labs now including estradiol, hep serologies given elevated LFTs  -- Prescribed exemestane, which she can start after estradiol confirms post-menopausal status  -- Proceed with adjuvant radiation therapy  -- In the future: DEXA scan (will need to discuss plan for scan as described below)  -- Check estradiol again in 3-6 months to ensure still in menopause    # Anxiety/PTSD  ***** has severe anxiety/PTSD for which she is followed by Dr. ***** *****. Lying on her back and enclosed places/scans can cause severe anxiety. She does not need any scans now, but we will keep this is mind for the future  -- Communicated with her outpatient psychiatrist Dr. ***** ***** via email  -- Continue home duloxetine, celebrex    # Right axilla erythema c/w fungal infection   -- Recommended anti-fungal topical for suspected fungal infection in right armpit; instructed her to let us know if worsening      Spent a total of 70 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures.

An ***** before surgery was 5.  She could not tolerate an MRI due to PTSD/anxiety.    On 08/27/20 she had a lumpectomy and ***** with IORT for a 2.2 cm grade 2 IDC with associated DCIS and 1/1 positive nodes, with 1.1 cm of disease.  ER/PR+ and ***** now 15%.    Dr. ***** recommended radiation therapy for 3 weeks, with sedation for her simulation due to anxiety.    PMH includes morbid obesity, hepatic steatosis, IBS, fibromyalgia, arthritis, anxiety, borderline HTN.  Actively treated by psychiatry, on cymbalta and celebrex.  She is taking ***** for hot flashes.    Married, lives with her husband G0P0.  Amenorrheic since age 50.    On exam her surgical incision is well healed, she has a rash in the right axilla.

We discussed risk of recurrence from her node positive disease, and the use of endocrine therapy.  We are concerned about the drug interaction with tamoxifen and cymbalta and the joint pains with aromatase inhibitors.  In addition, she would not be able to have a bone density as she is not able to tolerate scans.    Discussed in detail    1. Proceed with radiation therapy - will start end of September 29.
