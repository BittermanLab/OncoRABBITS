Based on the report, it looks like you might be considering adjuvant endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, such as anastrozole, in addition to radiation therapy. Here’s what you need to know about the side effects of these treatments:

### Aromatase Inhibitors (e.g., Anastrozole)
Aromatase inhibitors are commonly used in postmenopausal women to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence. They work by lowering the amount of estrogen in your body, which can help prevent the growth of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer cells.

#### Common Side Effects:
1. **Joint and Muscle Pain**: Many patients experience arthralgia (joint pain) and myalgia (muscle pain). This can range from mild discomfort to more severe pain that can affect daily activities.
